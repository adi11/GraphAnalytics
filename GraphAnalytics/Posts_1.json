Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are \"fixed\" and which are flexible. For example, the model may allow you to define your own network structure (or even learn it) with certain constraints. You have to decide whether this flexibility is sufficient for your purposes. Then within a particular network structure, you can learn parameters given a specific training dataset.</p>\n\n<p>You rarely hard-code behavior in AI/ML solutions. It's all about modelling the underlying situation and accommodating different situations by tweaking elements of the model.</p>\n\n<p>In your example, perhaps you might have the robot learn how to detect obstacles (by analyzing elements in the environment), or you might have it keep track of where the obstacles were and which way they were moving.</p>\n",

Generally, though, I'd say you're certainly dealing with big data if the scale is such that it's no longer feasible to manage with more traditional technologies such as RDBMS, at least without complementing them with big data technologies such as Hadoop.</p>\n\n<p>How big your data has to actually be for that to be the case is debatable.  Here's a (somewhat provocative) <a href=\"http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html\">blog post</a> that claims that it's not really the case for less than 5 TB of data.  (To be clear, it doesn't claim \"Less than 5 TB isn't big data\", but just \"Less than 5 TB isn't big enough that you need Hadoop\".)</p>\n\n<p>But even on smaller datasets, big data technologies like Hadoop can have other advantages, including being well suited to batch operations, playing well with unstructured data (as well as data whose structure isn't known in advance or could change), horizontal scalability (scaling by adding more nodes instead of beefing up your existing servers), and (as one of the commenters on the above-linked post notes) the ability to integrate your data processing with external data sets (think of a map-reduce where the mapper makes a call to another server).  Other technologies associated with big data, like NoSql databases, emphasize fast performance and consistent availability while dealing with large sets of data, as well also being able to handle semi-unstructured data and to scale horizontally.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, traditional RDBMS have their own advantages including ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and better performance for certain operations, as well as being more standardized, more mature, and (for many users) more familiar.  So even for indisputably \"big\" data, it may make sense to load at least a portion of your data into a traditional SQL database and use that in conjunction with big data technologies.</p>\n\n<p>So, a more generous definition would be that you have big data so long as it's big enough that big data technologies provide some added value for you.  But as you can see, that can depend not just on the size of your data but on how you want to work with it and what sort of requirements you have in terms of flexibility, consistency, and performance.  <em>How</em> you're using your data is more relevant to the question than what you're using it <em>for</em> (e.g. data mining).  That said, uses like data mining and machine learning are more likely to yield useful results if you have a big enough data set to work with.</p>\n",

The sample space for categorical data is discrete, and doesn't have a natural origin.  A Euclidean distance function on such a space isn't really meaningful.  As someone put it, \"The fact a snake possesses neither wheels nor legs allows us to say nothing about the relative value of wheels and legs.\" (from <a href=\"http://www.daylight.com/meetings/mug04/Bradshaw/why_k-modes.html\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>There's a variation of k-means known as k-modes, introduced in <a href=\"http://www.cs.ust.hk/~qyang/Teaching/537/Papers/huang98extensions.pdf\">this paper</a> by Zhexue Huang, which is suitable for categorical data.   Note that the solutions you get are sensitive to initial conditions, as discussed <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0603/0603120.pdf\">here</a> (PDF), for instance.</p>\n\n<p>Huang's paper (linked above) also has a section on \"k-protoypes\" which applies to data with a mix of categorical and numeric features.  It uses a distance measure which mixes the Hamming distance for categorical features and the Euclidean distance for numeric features.</p>\n\n<p>A Google search for \"k-means mix of categorical data\" turns up quite a few more recent papers on various algorithms for k-means-like clustering with a mix of categorical and numeric data.  (I haven't yet read them, so I can't comment on their merits.)  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Actually, what you suggest (converting categorical attributes to binary values, and then doing k-means as if these were numeric values) is another approach that has been tried before (predating k-modes).  (See Ralambondrainy, H. 1995. A conceptual version of the k-means algorithm. Pattern Recognition Letters, 16:1147–1157.)  But I believe the k-modes approach is preferred for the reasons I indicated above.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>From my point of view, this question is suitable for a two-step answer. The first part, let us call it <em>soft preprocessing</em>, could be taken as the usage of different data mining algorithms to preprocess data in such a way that makes it suitable for further analyses. Notice that this could be the analysis itself, in case the goal is simple enough to be tackled in a single shot.</p>\n\n<p>The second part, the <em>hard preprocessing</em>, actually comes prior to any other process, and is may be taken as the usage of simple tools or scripts to clean up data, selecting specific contents to be processed. To this problem, POSIX provides us with a wonderous set of magic tools, which can be used to compose concise -- and very powerful -- preprocessing scripts.</p>\n\n<p>For example, for people who deal with data coming from social websites (twitter, facebook, ...), the <em>data retrieval</em> usually yields files with very specific format -- although not always nicely structure, as they may contain missing fields, and so. For these cases, a simple <code>awk</code> script could clean up the data, producing a <em>valid</em> input file for later processing. From the magic set, one may also point out <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>paste</code>, <code>sort</code>, and a whole multitude of other tools.</p>\n\n<p>In case simple the source file has too many nitty-gritties, it may also be necessary to produce a bundle of methods to clean up data. In such cases, it is usually better to use scripting languages (other than shell ones), such as Python, Ruby, and Perl. This allows for building up <em>API</em>'s to select specific data in a very straightforward and reusable way. Such <em>API</em>'s are sometimes made public by their writers, such as <a href=\"http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/\">IMDbPY</a>, <a href=\"https://api.stackexchange.com/docs\">Stack Exchange API</a>, and many others.</p>\n\n<p>So, answering the question: are there any best practices? It usually depends on your task. If you will always deal with the same data format, it's commonly best to write an <em>organized</em> script to preprocess it; whereas, if you just need a simple and fast clean up on some dataset, count on POSIX tools for concise shell scripts that will do the whole job <strong>much</strong> faster than a Python script, or so. Since the <em>clean up</em> depends both on the dataset and on your purposes, it's hard to have everything already done. Yet, there are lots of API's that puts you halfway through with the problem.</p>\n",

To make it more straightforward, consider the following example: you're hired by some scientists to provide them with a model to predict the growth of some kind of plants. The scientists have given you information collected from their work \nwith such plants throughout a whole year, and they shall continuously give you information on the future development of their plantation.</p>\n\n<p>So, you run through the data received, and build up a model out of it. Now suppose that, in your model, you considered just as many characteristics as possible to always find out the exact behavior of the plants you saw in the initial dataset. Now, as the production continues, you'll always take into account those characteristics, and will produce very <em>fine-grained</em> results. However, if the plantation eventually suffer from some seasonal change, the results you will receive may fit your model in such a way that your predictions will begin to fail (either saying that the growth will slow down, while it shall actually speed up, or the opposite).</p>\n\n<p>Apart from being unable to detect such small variations, and to usually classify your entries incorrectly, the <em>fine-grain</em> on the model, i.e., the great amount of variables, may cause the processing to be too costly. Now, imagine that your data is already complex.

Querying, or\n  traversing, the graph involves following paths. Because of the\n  fundamentally path-oriented nature of the datamodel, the majority of\n  path-based graph database operations are highly aligned with the way\n  in which the data is laid out, making them extremely efficient. In\n  their book Neo4j in Action, Partner and Vukotic perform an experiment\n  using a relational store and Neo4j.</p>\n  \n  <p>The comparison shows that the graph database is substantially quicker\n  for connected data than a relational store.Partner and Vukotic’s\n  experiment seeks to find friends-of-friends in a social network, to a\n  maximum depth of five. Given any two persons chosen at random, is\n  there a path that connects them which is at most five relationships\n  long? For a social network containing 1,000,000 people, each with\n  approximately 50 friends, the results strongly suggest that graph\n  databases are the best choice for connected data, as we see in Table\n  2-1.</p>\n  \n  <p>Table 2-1. Finding extended friends in a relational database versus efficient finding in Neo4j</p>\n\n<pre><code>Depth   RDBMS Execution time (s)    Neo4j Execution time (s)     Records returned\n2       0.016                       0.01                         ~2500    \n3       30.267                      0.168                        ~110,000 \n4       1543.505                    1.359                        ~600,000 \n5       Unfinished                  2.132                        ~800,000\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>At depth two (friends-of-friends) both the relational database and the graph database perform well enough for us to consider using them in an online system. While the Neo4j query runs in two-thirds the time of the relational one, an end-user would barely notice the the difference in milliseconds between the two. By the time we reach depth three (friend-of-friend-of-friend), however, it’s clear that the relational database can no longer deal with the query in a reasonable timeframe: the thirty seconds it takes to complete would be completely unacceptable for an online system. In contrast, Neo4j’s response time remains relatively flat: just a fraction of a second to perform the query—definitely quick enough for an online system.</p>\n  \n  <p>At depth four the relational database exhibits crippling latency,\n  making it practically useless for an online system. Neo4j’s timings\n  have deteriorated a little too, but the latency here is at the\n  periphery of being acceptable for a responsive online system. Finally,\n  at depth five, the relational database simply takes too long to\n  complete the query. Neo4j, in contrast, returns a result in around two\n  seconds. At depth five, it transpires almost the entire network is our\n  friend: for many real-world use cases, we’d likely trim the results,\n  and the timings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Questions are:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is this a reasonable test to emulate what one might except to find in a social network? <em>(Meaning do real social networks normally have nodes with approximately 50 friends for example; seems like the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_rich_get_richer_%28statistics%29\">rich get richer</a>\" model would be more natural for social networks, though might be wrong.)</em></li>\n<li>Regardless of the naturalness of the emulation, is there any reason to believe the results are off, or unreproducible? </li>\n</ul>\n",

As Christopher said, magnitude of effect a way to treat this.  Combining these two ideas, you might use a confidence interval around your magnitude of effect, and apply a false discovery rate correction to the p-value of the confidence interval.  The effects for which even the lowest bound of the corrected confidence interval is high are likely to be strong effects, regardless of huge data set size.  I am not aware of any published paper that combines confidence intervals with false discovery rate correction in this way, but it seems like a straightforward and intuitively understandable approach.</p>\n\n<p>To make this even better, use a non-parametric way to estimate confidence intervals.  Assuming a distribution is likely to give very optimistic estimates here, and even fitting a distribution to the data is likely to be inaccurate.  Since the information about the shape of the distribution past the edges of the confidence interval comes from a relatively small subsample of the data, this is where it really pays to be careful.

There is an infinite number of terms in the world (even if you assume that only terms properly spelled will be entered), and there is an exponential number of queries from these <code>n -&gt; inf</code> terms (<code>2^n</code>). So what is done? Caching. But if there are so many queries/results, which ones to cache? Caching policies. The most frequent/popular/relevant-for-the-user queries are the ones cached.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>wouldn't the hardware latency in Google's hardware be huge? Even if the data in Google were all stored in TB/s SSDs</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nowdays, with such highly developed processors, people tend to think that every possible task that must finish within a second (or less), and that deals with so much data, must be processed by extremely powerful processors with multiple cores and lots of memory. However, the one thing <em>ruling</em> market is money, and the investors are not interested in wasting it. So what is done?</p>\n\n<p>The preference is actually for having lots of machines, each using simple/accessible (in terms of cost) processors, which lowers the price of building up the multitude of clusters there are. And yes, it does work. The main bottleneck always boils down to disk, if you consider simple measurements of <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uf6al.gif\">performance</a>. But once there are so many machines, one can afford to load things up to main memory, instead of working on hard disks.</p>\n\n<p>Memory cards are <em>expensive</em> for us, mere human beings, but they are very cheap for enterprises that buy lots of such cards at once. Since it's not costly, having much memory as needed to load indexes and keep caches at hand is not a problem. And since there are so many machines, there is no need for super fast processors, as you can direct queries to different places, and have clusters of machines responsible for attending <em>specific geographical regions</em>, which allows for more <em>specialized</em> data caching, and even better response times.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does MapReduce help solve this problem?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although I don't think that using or not MapReduce is restricted information inside Google, I'm not conversant about this point. However, Google's implementation of MapReduce (which is surely <em>not</em> Hadoop) must have lots of optimizations, many involving the aspects discussed above. So, the architecture of MapReduce probably helps guiding how the computations are physically distributed, but there are many other points to be considered to justify such speed in querying time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Okay, so I understand that popular searches can be cached in memory. But what about unpopular searches?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The graph below presents a curve of how the <em>kinds</em> of queries occur. You can see that there are three main kinds of searches, each of them holding approximately 1/3 of the volume of queries (area below curve). The plot shows power law, and reinforces the fact that smaller queries are the most popular. The second third of queries are still feasible to process, since they hold few words. But the set of so-called <em>obscure queries</em>, which usually consist of non-experienced users' queries, are not a negligible part of the queries.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CpcNf.jpg\" alt=\"Heavy-tailed distribution\"></p>\n\n<p>And there lies space for novel solutions. Since it's not just one or two queries (but one third of them), they must have <em>relevant</em> results. If you type in something <em>much too obscure</em> in a Google search, it shan't take longer to return a list of results, but will most probably show you something it <em>inferred</em> you'd like to say. Or it may simply state that there was no document with such terms -- or even cut down your search to 32 words (which just happened to me in a random test here).</p>\n\n<p>There are dozens of appliable heuristics, which may be either to ignore some words, or to try to break the query into smaller ones, and gather the most <em>popular</em> results. And all these solutions can be tailored and tweaked to respect <em>feasible waiting times</em> of, say, less then a second? :D</p>\n",

Orient is a Graph-Document database server written entirely in Java. </p>\n\n<p>In graph databases, relationships are considered first class citizens and therefore traversing those relationships can be done pretty quickly. Orient is also a document database which would allow you the kind of schema-free architecture it sounds like you would need. The real reason I suggest Orient, however, is because of its extensiblity. It supports streaming via sockets, and the entire database can be embedded into another application. Finally, it can be scaled efficiently and/or can work entirely through memory. So, with some Java expertise, you can actually run your preset queries against the database in memory.</p>\n\n<p>We are doing something similar. In creating an app/site for social science research collaboration, we found ourselves with immensely complex data models. We ended up writing several of the queries using the Gremlin Traversal Language (a subset of Groovy, which is, of course, Java at its heart), and then exposing those queries through the binary connection server of the OrientDB. So, the client opens a TCP socket, sends a short binary message, and the query is executing in Java directly against the in-memory database.</p>\n\n<p>OrientDB also supports writing function queries in Javascript, and you can use Node.js to interact directly with an Orient instance.</p>\n\n<p>For something of this size, I would want to use Orient in conjunction with Hadoop or something like that. You can also use Orient in conjunction with esper.</p>\n\n<p>Consider:\nAn introduction to orient: <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/\">http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/</a></p>\n\n<p>Complex, real-time queries: <a href=\"http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/\">http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/</a></p>\n\n<p>A discussion about streaming options with java and orient: <a href=\"https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227\">https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227</a></p>\n",

For example, DBSCAN uses epsilon-neighborhoods around a point; there is nothing in there that specifically says the triangle inequality matters.  So you can probably use DBSCAN, although you may have to do some kind of nonstandard spatial index to do efficient lookups in your case.  Your version of epsilon-neighborhood will likely be sim > 1/epsilon rather than the other way around.  Same story with k-means and related algorithms.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can you construct a metric from your similarity?  One possibility: dist(ei, ej) = min( sim(ei, ek) + sim(ek, ej) ) for all k ...  Alternately, can you provide an upper  bound such that sim(ei, ej) &lt; sim(ei, ek) + sim(ek, ej) + d, for all k and some positive constant d?  Intuitively, large sim values means closer together: is 1/sim metric-like?  What about 1/(sim + constant)?  What about min( 1/sim(ei, ek) + 1/sim(ek, ej) ) for all k? (that last is guaranteed to be a metric, btw)</p></li>\n<li><p>An alternate construction of a metric is to do an embedding.  As a first step, you can try to map your points ei -> xi, such that xi minimize sum( abs( sim(ei, ej) - f( dist(xi, xj) ) ), for some suitable function f and metric dist.  The function f converts distance in the embedding to a similarity-like value; you'd have to experiment a bit, but 1/dist or exp^-dist are good starting points.  You'd also have to experiment on the best dimension for xi.  From there, you can use conventional clustering on xi.  The idea here is that you can almost (in a best fit sense) convert your distances in the embedding to similarity values, so they would cluster correctly.</p></li>\n<li><p>On the use of predefined parameters, all algorithms have some tuning.  DBSCAN can find the number of clusters, but you still need to give it some parameters.  In general, tuning requires multiple runs of the algorithm with different values for the tunable parameters, together with some function that evaluates goodness-of-clustering (either calculated separately, provided by the clustering algorithm itself, or just eyeballed :)  If the character of your data doesn't change, you can tune once and then use those fixed parameters; if it changes then you have to tune for each run.  You can find that out by tuning for each run and then comparing how well the parameters from one run work on another, compared to the parameters specifically tuned for that.</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

I know the wide-spread use of R in data science educational materials and the good data analysis libraries available for it, but sometimes it just depend on the team.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, for people already familiar with programming, using Python provides much more flexibility and productivity boost compared to a language like R, which is not as well-designed and powerful compared to Python in terms of a programming language. As an evidence, in a data mining course in my university, the best final project was written in Python, although the others has access to R's rich data analysis library. That is, sometimes the overall productivity (considering learning materials, documentation, etc.) for Python may be better than R even in the lack of special-purpose data analysis libraries for Python. Also, there are some good articles explaining the fast pace of Python in data science: <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/11/25/python-displacing-r-as-the-programming-language-for-data-science\">Python Displacing R</a> and <a href=\"http://wesmckinney.com/blog/?p=77\">Rich Scientific Data Structures in Python</a> that may soon fill the gap of available libraries for R.</p>\n\n<p>Another important reason for not using R is when working with real world Big Data problems, contrary to academical only problems, there is much need for other tools and techniques, like data parsing, cleaning, visualization, web scrapping, and a lot of others that are much easier using a general purpose programming language. This may be why the default language used in many Hadoop courses (including the Udacity's <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ud617\">online course</a>) is Python.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Recently DARPA has also invested $3 million to help fund Python's data processing and visualization capabilities for big data jobs, which is clearly a sign of Python's future in Big Data.

                "_Body": "<p>The answers presented so far are very nice, but I was also expecting an emphasis on a particular difference between parallel and distributed processing: the code executed. Considering parallel processes, the code executed is the same, regardless of the level of parallelism (instruction, data, task). You write a <em>single code</em>, and it will be executed by different threads/processors, e.g., while computing matrices products, or generating permutations.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, distributed computing involves the execution of different algorithms/programs at the same time in different processors (from one or more machines). Such computations are later merged into a intermediate/final results by using the available means of data communication/synchronization (shared memory, network). Further, distributed computing is very appealing for BigData processing, as it allows for exploiting disk parallelism (usually the bottleneck for large databases).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, for the level of parallelism, it may be taken rather as a constraint on the synchronization. For example, in GPGPU, which is single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD), the parallelism occurs by having different inputs for a single instruction, each pair <em>(data_i, instruction)</em> being executed by a different thread. Such is the restraint that, in case of divergent branches, it is necessary to discard lots of unnecessary computations, until the threads reconverge. For CPU threads, though, they commonly diverge; yet, one may use synchronization structures to grant concurrent execution of specific sections of the code.</p>\n",

For us, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/data-science\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;data-science&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">data-science</a> is more about testing a hypothesis, and typically the data have been collected just for that purpose. <a href=\"/questions/tagged/data-mining\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;data-mining&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">data-mining</a> is more about sifting through existing data, looking for structure, and perhaps generating hypotheses.

We can denote the parameters of the Dirichlet as a vector of size K of the form ~ 1/B(a) * Product(x_i ^ (a_i-1)), where a is the vector of size K of the parameters, and sum of x_i = 1.</p>\n\n<p>Now the LDA uses some constructs like:\n- a document can have multiple topics (because of this multiplicity, we need the Dirichlet distribution); and there is a Dirichlet distribution which models this relation\n- words can also belong to multiple topics, when you consider them outside of a document; so here we need another Dirichlet to model this</p>\n\n<p>The previous two are distributions which you do not really see from data, this is why is called latent, or hidden.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in Bayesian inference you use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior probability. For simplicity, let's say you have data <em>x</em> and you have a model for this data governed by some parameters theta. In order to infer values for this parameters, in full Bayesian inference you will infer the posterior probability of these parameters using Bayes' rule with <em>p(theta|x) = p(x|theta)p(theta|alpha)/p(x|alpha)</em>. In plain words is <em>posterior probability = likelihood x prior probability / marginal likelihood</em>. Note that here comes an <em>alpha</em>. This is your initial belief about this distribution, and is the parameter of the prior distribution. Usually this is chosen in such a way that will have a conjugate prior (so the distribution of the posterior is the same with the distribution of the prior) and often to encode some knowledge if you have one or to have maximum entropy if you know nothing.</p>\n\n<p>The parameters of the prior are called <em>hyperparameters</em>. So, in LDA, both topic distributions, over documents and over words have also correspondent priors, which are denoted usually with alpha and beta, and because are the parameters of the prior distributions are called hyperparameters. </p>\n\n<p>Now about choosing priors. If you plot some Dirichlet distributions you will note that if the individual parameters <em>alpha_k</em> have the same value, the pdf is symmetric in the simplex defined by the <em>x</em> values, which is the minimum or maximum for pdf is at the center. </p>\n\n<p>If all the alpha_k have values lower than unit the maximum is found at corners</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5khZE.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></p>\n\n<p>or can if all values alpha_k are the same and greater than 1 the maximum will be found in center like </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/prmlfigs-png/Figure2.5c.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></p>\n\n<p>It is easy to see that if values for alpha_k are not equal the symmetry is broken and the maximum will be found near bigger values. </p>\n\n<p>Additional, please note that values for priors parameters produce smooth pdfs of the distribution as the values of the parameters are near 1. So if you have great confidence that something is clearly distributed in a way you know, with a high degree of confidence, than values far from 1 in absolute value are to be used, if you do not have such kind of knowledge than values near 1 would be encode this lack of knowledge. It is easy to see why 1 plays such a role in Dirichlet distribution from the formula of the distribution itself.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to understand this is to see that prior encode prior-knowledge. In the same time you might think that prior encode some prior seen data. This data was not saw by the algorithm itself, it was saw by you, you learned something, and you can model prior according to what you know (learned). So in the prior parameters (hyperparameters) you encode also how big this data set you apriori saw, because the sum of alpha_k can be that also as the size of this more or less imaginary data set. So the bigger the prior data set, the bigger is the confidence, the bigger the values of alpha_k you can choose, the sharper the surface near maximum value, which means also less doubts. </p>\n\n<p>Hope it helped.</p>\n\n<p>PS: It's a hell to write something without LaTeX notation. I hope moderators/administrators will do something.</p>\n",

If we treat -1 and 1 as ratings, there will be some problem. For example, user 1 likes movie A which scores high in one factor (e.g. having glorious background music) in the latent factor space. The system recommends movie B which also scores high in \"glorious background music\", but for some reason user 1 is too busy to look into the recommendation, and we have a -1 rating movie B. If we just treat 1 or -1 equally, then the system might be discouraged to recommend movie with glorious BGM to user 1 while user 1 still loves movie with glorious BGM. I think this situation is to be avoided.</p>\n",

This is straightforward within a single analytics or stats platform---be it Python, R, Stata, etc.---but I'm curious where best to locate this step in a multi-platform workflow.</p>\n\n<p>It's simple enough to do this in Python, either with the <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation-of-missing-values\"><code>sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer</code></a> class, using the <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html\"><code>pandas.DataFrame.fillna</code></a> method, or by hand (depending upon the complexity of the imputation method used). But since I'm going to be using this for dozens or hundreds of columns across hundreds of millions of records, I wonder if there's a more efficient way to do this directly through SQL ahead of time. Aside from the potential efficiencies of doing this in a distributed platform like Vertica, this would have the added benefit of allowing us to create an automated pipeline for building \"complete\" versions of tables, so we don't need to fill in a new set of missing values from scratch every time we want to run a model.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been able to find much guidance about this, but I imagine that we could:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>create a table of substitute values (e.g., mean/median/mode, either overall or by group) for each incomplete column</li>\n<li>join the substitute value table with the original table to assign a substitute value for each row and incomplete column</li>\n<li>use a series of case statements to take the original value if available and the substitute value otherwise</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is this a reasonable thing to do in Vertica/SQL, or is there a good reason not to bother and just handle it in Python instead?

I will give you some examples:\n- a marketplace encoded as N/A, which I missed and considered to be North/America\n- numbers like -999.0, because the data producer could not find a better replacement for missing data\n- number like 0 for blood pressure or body temperature, instead of missing data (it is hard to imagine a living human with 0 blood pressure)\n- multiple placeholders for missing data, due to the fact that the data was collected from various sources</p>\n\n<p>After that you need to understand what kind of imputation would resemble better the information from your data for a given task.

                "_Body": "<p>Christopher is right about the size of the array. To be simplistic about it, if this translates to 1.6B floats, at 16 bytes per float (32-bit version; 64-bit is bigger), then you're trying to create an array of about 26 GB. Even if you have the RAM for that, I'd imagine that it's probably going to overload something else along the way. </p>\n\n<p>(Maybe not, but generally speaking, any operations that are that computationally intensive should first raise the question of whether you are doing the right calculation in the first place. And if you do need to do something of that magnitude, you should then try to break it down into more manageable chunks that can be run in parallel or distributed across machines.)</p>\n\n<p>But given that you are describing a very, very wide dataset (~40k columns x 180 rows), I wonder whether you really want to take the covariance matrix of the transposed dataset (so 180x180 = 32,400 covariances)? That would be a far more tractable problem, and it's easier to see how it might be useful.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, you're probably far better off calculating each pairwise covariance (or at least, the vector of cov(x_i,x_k) for all x_k != x_i) at the point where you'll actually use it, rather than calculating a giant matrix initially then referring back to it later. Memory issues aside, it'll make your life much easier if you start running things in parallel, and will help ensure you don't waste resources on unnecessary calculations.</p>\n",

MapReduce allows you to operate over huge amounts of data- with a lot of work put in to prevent failure due to hardware. MapReduce is a poor choice for computing results on the fly because it is slow. (A typical MapReduce job takes on the order of minutes or hours, not microseconds)</p>\n\n<p>A MapReduce job takes a file (or some data store) as an input and writes a file of results. If you want these results available to an application, it is your responsibility to put this data in a place that is accessible. This is likely slow, and there will be a lag between the values you can display, and the values that represent your system in its current state.</p>\n\n<p>An important distinction to make when considering using MapReduce in building realtime systems is that of training your model, and applying your model. If you think your model parameters do not change quickly, you can fit them with MapReduce, and then have a mechanism for accessing these pre-fit parameters when you want to apply your model.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Storm</strong>: A real-time, streaming computational system. Storm is online framework, meaning, in this sense, a service that interacts with a running application. In contrast to MapReduce, it receives small pieces of data (not a whole file) as they are processed in your application. You define a DAG of operations to perform on the data. A common and simple use case for Storm is tracking counters, and using that information to populate a real-time dashboard.</p>\n\n<p>Storm doesn't have anything (necessarily) to do with persisting your data. Here, streaming is another way to say keeping the information you care about and throwing the rest away. In reality, you probably have a persistence layer in your application that has already recorded the data, and so this a good and justified separation of concerns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you want to know more...</strong>\nIf you would like to learn more about real-time systems that that fit parameters with MR and apply the models a different way <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/hbasecon-2013-24063525\" rel=\"nofollow\">here are slides for a talk I gave on building real-time recommendation engines on HBase.</a> </p>\n\n<p>An excellent paper that marries real-time counting and persistence in an interesting way is <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242610\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google News Personalization: Scalable Online Collaborative Filtering</a> </p>\n\n<p>Another interesting marriage of MR and Storm is <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/summingbird/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">SummingBird</a>.

                "_Body": "<p>Having done the rewriting game over and over myself (and still doing it), my immediate reaction was <em>adaptability</em>.</p>\n\n<p>While frameworks and libraries have a huge arsenal of (possibly intertwinable) routines for standard tasks, their framework property often (always?) disallows shortcuts.  In fact, most frameworks have some sort of core infrastructure around which a core layer of basic functionality is implemented.  More specific functionality makes use of the basic layer and is placed in a second layer around the core.</p>\n\n<p>Now by shortcuts I mean going straight from a second layer routine to another second layer routine without using the core.  Typical example (from my domain) would be timestamps: You have a timestamped data source of some kind.  Thus far the job is simply to read the data off the wire and pass it to the core so your other code can feast on it.</p>\n\n<p>Now your industry changes the default timestamp format for a very good reason (in my case they went from unix time to GPS time).  Unless your framework is industry-specific it is very unlikely that they're willing to change the core representation of time, so you end up using a framework that <em>almost</em> does what you want.  Every time you access your data you have to convert it to industry-time-format first, and every time you want it modified you have to convert it back to whatever the core deems appropriate.  There is no way that you can hand over data straight from the source to a sink without double conversion.</p>\n\n<p>This is where your hand-crafted frameworks will shine, it's just a minor change and you're back modelling the real world whereas all other (non-industry-specific) frameworks will now have a performance disadvantage.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, the discrepancy between the real world and the model will add up.  With an off-the-shelf framework you'd soon be facing questions like: How can I represent <code>this</code> in <code>that</code> or how do make routine <code>X</code> accept/produce <code>Y</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So far this wasn't about C/C++.  But if, for some reason, you can't change the framework, i.e. you do have to put up with double conversion of data to go from one end to another, then you'd typically employ something that minimises the additional overhead.  In my case, a TAI->UTC or UTC->TAI converter is best left to raw C (or an FPGA).  There is no elegance possible, no profound smart data structure that makes the problem trivial.  It's just a boring switch statement, and why not use a language whose compilers are good at optimising exactly that?</p>\n",

You could apply machine learning algorithms, analyze it using visualizations, combine it with external data about the region, ethnic makeup, changes to environment over time, political information, weather patterns, etc.  All of that would be \"data science\" in my opinion.

For more info, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/forget-2002-this-years-oakland-as-are-the-real-em-moneyball-em-team/279927/\">http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/forget-2002-this-years-oakland-as-are-the-real-em-moneyball-em-team/279927/</a></li>\n<li><strong>Cricket</strong>: SAP Labs has come up with an auction analytics tool that has given insights about impact players to buy in the 2014 Indian Premier League auction for the Kolkata Knight Riders team, which eventually went on to win the 2014 IPL <strong>Championship</strong>. For more info, <a href=\"http://scn.sap.com/community/hana-in-memory/blog/2014/06/10/sap-hana-academy-cricket-demo--how-sap-hana-powered-the-kolkata-knight-riders-to-ipl-championship\">http://scn.sap.com/community/hana-in-memory/blog/2014/06/10/sap-hana-academy-cricket-demo--how-sap-hana-powered-the-kolkata-knight-riders-to-ipl-championship</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, yes, statistical analysis of the player records can give us insights about <strong>which players are more likely to perform but not which players will perform</strong>. So, machine learning, a close cousin of statistical analysis will be proving to be a game changer.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>I do not know a standard answer to this, but I thought about it some times ago and I have some ideas to share. </p>\n\n<p>When you have one confusion matrix, you have more or less a picture of how you classification model confuse (mis-classify) classes. When you repeat classification tests you will end up having multiple confusion matrices. The question is how to get a meaningful aggregate confusion matrix. The answer depends on what is the meaning of meaningful (pun intended). I think there is not a single version of meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>One way is to follow the rough idea of multiple testing. In general, you test something multiple times in order to get more accurate results. As a general principle one can reason that averaging on the results of the multiple tests reduces the variance of the estimates, so as a consequence, it increases the precision of the estimates. You can proceed in this way, of course, by summing position by position and then dividing by the number of tests. You can go further and instead of estimating only a value for each cell of the confusion matrix, you can also compute some confidence intervals, t-values and so on. This is OK from my point of view. But it tell only one side of the story.</p>\n\n<p>The other side of the story which might be investigated is how stable are the results for the same instances. To exemplify that I will take an extreme example. Suppose you have a classification model for 3 classes. Suppose that these classes are in the same proportion. If your model is able to predict one class perfectly and the other 2 classes with random like performance, you will end up having 0.33 + 0.166 + 0.166 = 0.66 misclassification ratio. This might seem good, but even if you take a look on a single confusion matrix you will not know that your performance on the last 2 classes varies wildly. Multiple tests can help. But averaging the confusion matrices would reveal this? My belief is not. The averaging will give the same result more or less, and doing multiple tests will only decrease the variance of the estimation. However it says nothing about the wild instability of prediction.</p>\n\n<p>So another way to do compose the confusion matrices would better involve a prediction density for each instance. One can build this density by counting for each instance, the number of times it was predicted a given class. After normalization, you will have for each instance a prediction density rather a single prediction label. You can see that a single prediction label is similar with a degenerated density where you have probability of 1 for the predicted class and 0 for the other classes for each separate instance. Now having this densities one can build a confusion matrix by adding the probabilities from each instance and predicted class to the corresponding cell of the aggregated confusion matrix. </p>\n\n<p>One can argue that this would give similar results like the previous method. However I think that this might be the case sometimes, often when the model has low variance, the second method is less affected by how the samples from the tests are drawn, and thus more stable and closer to the reality. </p>\n\n<p>Also the second method might be altered in order to obtain a third method, where one can assign as prediction the label with highest density from the prediction of a given instance. </p>\n\n<p>I do not implemented those things but I plan to study further because I believe might worth spending some time. </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Perhaps a good way to paraphrase the question is, what are the advantages compared to alternative formats?  </p>\n\n<p>The main alternatives are, I think: a database, text files, or another packed/binary format.</p>\n\n<p>The database options to consider are probably a columnar store or NoSQL, or for small self-contained datasets SQLite.  The main advantage of the database is the ability to work with data much larger than memory, to have random or indexed access, and to add/append/modify data quickly.  The main *dis*advantage is that it is much slower than HDF, for problems in which the entire dataset needs to be read in and processed.  Another disadvantage is that, with the exception of embedded-style databases like SQLite, a database is a system (requiring admnistration, setup, maintenance, etc) rather than a simple self-contained data store.  </p>\n\n<p>The text file format options are XML/JSON/CSV.  They are cross-platform/language/toolkit, and are a good archival format due to the ability to be self-describing (or obvious :).  If uncompressed, they are huge (10x-100x HDF), but if compressed, they can be fairly space-efficient (compressed XML is about the same as HDF).  The main disadvantage here is again speed: parsing text is much, much slower than HDF.</p>\n\n<p>The other binary formats (npy/npz numpy files, blz blaze files, protocol buffers, Avro, ...) have very similar properties to HDF, except they are less widely supported (may be limited to just one platform: numpy) and may have specific other limitations.  They typically do not offer a compelling advantage.</p>\n\n<p>HDF is a good complement to databases, it may make sense to run a query to produce a roughly memory-sized dataset and then cache it in HDF if the same data would be used more than once.  If you have a dataset which is fixed, and usually processed as a whole, storing it as a collection of appropriately sized HDF files is not a bad option.  If you have a dataset which is updated often, staging some of it as HDF files periodically might still be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, HDF is a good format for data which is read (or written) typically as a whole; it is the lingua franca or common/preferred interchange format for many applications due to wide support and compatibility, decent as an archival format, and very fast.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. To give this some practical context, my most recent experience comparing HDF to alternatives, a certain small (much less than memory-sized) dataset took 2 seconds to read as HDF (and most of this is probably overhead from Pandas); ~1 minute to read from JSON; and 1 <em>hour</em> to write to database.  Certainly the database write could be sped up, but you'd better have a good DBA!  This is how it works out of the box.</p>\n",

So that's the reason why there's a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Using LDA for document modeling, one treats each \"topic\" as a distribution of words in some known vocabulary.  For each document a mixture of topics is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, and then each word in the document is an independent draw from that mixture (that is, selecting a topic and then using it to generate a word).</p>\n\n<p>For HDP (applied to document modeling), one also uses a Dirichlet process to capture the uncertainty in the number of topics.  So a common base distribution is selected which represents the countably-infinite set of possible topics for the corpus, and then the finite distribution of topics for each document is sampled from this base distribution.</p>\n\n<p>As far as pros and cons, HDP has the advantage that the maximum number of topics can be unbounded and learned from the data rather than specified in advance.  I suppose though it is more complicated to implement, and unnecessary in the case where a bounded number of topics is acceptable.</p>\n",

The process includes subjectingthe data to over\n  50 data sanity and quality checks. The results of those checks are trended over time to\n  ensure that the tolerances for data corruption and data domains aren’t changing adversely\n  and that the risk profiles being reported to investors and regulatory agencies are prudent\n  and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The results are reported through a data\n  quality dashboard to the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are ultimately\n  responsible for ensuring the accuracy of regulatory compliance reporting as well as\n  earnings forecasts to investors</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn't see any other finance related studies at Cloudera, but I didn't search very hard.

Therefore, it's great if you load your data once and execute multiple queries, but if you want to execute only one query for example, you might actually lose out in performance overall.</p>\n\n<p>-Cost Profile<br>\nWhich solution wins out in cost depends on the situation (like performance), but you probably need quite a lot of queries in order to make it cheaper than Hadoop (more specifically Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce). For example, if you are doing OLAP, it's very likely that Redshift comes out cheaper. If you do daily batch ETLs, Hadoop is more likely to come out cheaper.  </p>\n\n<p>Having said that, we've replaced part of our ETL that was done in Hive to Redshift, and it was a pretty great experience; mostly for the ease of development. Redshift's Query Engine is based on PostgreSQL and is very mature, compared to Hive's. Its ACID characteristics make it easier to reason about it, and the quicker response time allows more testing to be done. It's a great tool to have, but it won't replace Hadoop.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  As for setup complexity, I'd even say it's easier with Hadoop if you use AWS's EMR. Their tools are so mature that it's ridiculously easy to have your Hadoop job running. Tools and mechanisms surrounding Redshift's operation aren't that mature yet. For example, Redshift can't handle trickle loading and thus you have to come up with something that turns that into a batched load, which can add some complexity to your ETL. </p>\n",

All languages were designed to make some type of constructs more easy to build than others. And the knowledge and mastery of a programming language is more important and effective than the features of that language compared to others.   </p>\n\n<p>As far as I can see there are two dimensions of this question. The first dimension is the ability to explore, build proof of concepts or models at a fast pace, eventually having at hand enough tools to study what is going on (like statistical tests, graphics, measurement tools, etc). This kind of activity is usually preferred by researchers and data scientists (I always wonder what that means, but I use this term for its loose definition). They tend to rely on well-known and verified instruments, which can be used for proofs or arguments.</p>\n\n<p>The second dimension is the ability to extend, change, improve or even create tools, algorithms or models. In order to achieve that you need a proper programming language. Roughly all of them are the same. If you work for a company, than you depend a lot on the company's infrastructure, internal culture and your choices diminish significantly. Also, when you want to implement an algorithm for production use, you have to trust the implementation. And implementing in another language which you do not master will not help you much.</p>\n\n<p>I tend to favor for the first type of activity the R ecosystem. You have a great community, a huge set of tools, proofs that these tools works as expected. Also, you can consider Python, Octave (to name a few), which are reliable candidates.</p>\n\n<p>For the second task, you have to think before at what you really want. If you want robust production ready tools, then C/C++, Java, C# are great candidates. I consider Python as a second citizen in this category, together with Scala and friends. I do not want to start a flame war, it's my opinion only. But after more than 17 years as a developer, I tend to prefer a strict contract and my knowledge, than the freedom to do whatever you might think of (like it happens with a lot of dynamic languages).</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I want to learn as much as possible. I decided that I have to choose the hard way, which means to implement myself everything from scratch. I use R as a model and inspiration. It has great treasures in libraries and a lot of experience distilled. However, as a programming language R, for me at least is a nightmare. So I decided to use Java, and use no additional library. That is only because of my experience, and nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>If you have time, the best thing you can do is to spend some time with all these things. In this way you will earn for yourself the best answer possible, fitted for you. Dijkstra said once that the tools influence the way you think, so it is advisable to know your tools before letting them to model how you think.

To give you an example, suppose you have a binary classification model, with classes c1 and c2. For a given instance, your classifier would have to return a score for c1 and another for c2. If this score is a probability-like (preferrable), than something like p(c1), p(c2) would work. In plain English is translated like \"I (the model) classify this instance as c1 with probability p(c1), and as c2 with probability  p(c2)=1-p(c1)\". </p>\n\n<p>This applies for all type of classifiers, not only for decision trees. Having these scores you can than compute ROC or AUC by varying a threshold on p(c1) values, from the smallest to the greatest value.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you have an implementation of a decision tree and you want to change that implementation to return scores instead of labels you have to compute those values. The most used way for decision trees is to use the proportion of classes from the leaf nodes. So, for example you have built a decision tree and when you predict the class for an instance you arrive at a leaf node which have (stored from the learning phase) 10 instances of class c1 and 15 instances of class c2, you can use the ratios as the scores. So, in our example, you would return p(c1) = 10 / (10+15) = 0.4 probability of class c1 and p(c2) = 15/(10+15)=0.6 probability of being class c2.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading on the ROC curves, the best and inspiring source of information I found to be the Tom Fawcett paper called <a href=\"https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf&amp;ei=DYCZU96QGPOV7AaAx4CgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNECLoecin6ieT-0ymLQ--FoMjkMZw&amp;sig2=3bGE2y1N3I2Re_YWn0EDFA\" rel=\"nofollow\">An Introduction to ROC Analysis</a>, it's solid gold on this topic.</p>\n",

Model Building and Prediction phase. Typically, model building is performed as a batch process and <strong>predictions are done realtime</strong>. The model building process is a compute intensive process while the prediction happens in a jiffy. Therefore, performance of an algorithm in Python or R doesn't really affect the turn-around time of the user. Python 1, R 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Production:</strong> The real difference between Python and R comes in being production ready. Python, as such is a full fledged programming language and many organisations use it in their production systems. R is a statistical programming software favoured by many academia and due to the rise in data science and availability of libraries and being open source, the industry has started using R. Many of these organisations have their production systems either in Java, C++, C#, Python etc. So, ideally they would like to have the <strong>prediction system</strong> in the same language to reduce the latency and maintenance issues.\nPython 2, R 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Both the languages have enormous and reliable libraries. R has over 5000 libraries catering to many domains while Python has some incredible packages like <strong>Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib</strong>. Python 3, R 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Development:</strong> Both the language are interpreted languages. Many say that python has a good learning curve, it's almost like reading english (to put it on a lighter note) but R has a reputation of having a steeper learning curve. Also, both of them have good IDEs (Spyder etc for Python and RStudio for R). Python 4, R 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> R software initially had problems with large computations (say, like nxn matrix multiplications). But, this issue is addressed with the introduction of R by Revolution Analytics. They have re-written computation intensive operations in C which is blazingly fast. Python being a high level language is relatively slow. Python 4, R 3.</li>\n<li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> In data science, we frequently tend to plot data to showcase patterns to users. Therefore, visualisations become an important criteria in choosing a software and R completely kills Python in this regard. Thanks to Hadley Wickham for an incredible ggplot2 package. R wins hands down. Python 4, R 4.</li>\n<li><strong>Dealing with Big Data:</strong> One of the constraints of R is it stores the data in system memory (RAM). So, RAM capacity becomes a constraint when you are handling Big Data. Python does well, but I would say, as both R and Python have HDFS connectors, leveraging Hadoop infrastructure would give substantial performance improvement. So, Python 5, R 5.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, both the languages are equally good. Therefore, depending upon your domain and the place you work, you have got to smartly choose the right language.

The database is vendor-designed, so I have little control over the structure.  It's a sql representation of a class-based structure.  It looks a little bit like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Main-class table\n -sub-class table 1\n -sub-class table 2\n  -sub-sub-class table\n ...\n -sub-class table n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each table contains fields for each attribute of the class.  A join exists which contains all of the fields for each of the sub-classes which contains all of the fields in the class table and all of the fields in each parent class' table, joined by a unique identifier.</p>\n\n<p>There are hundreds of classes. which means thousands of views and tens of thousands of columns.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, there are multiple datasets, indicated by a field value in the Main-class table.  There is the production dataset, visible to all end users, and there are several other datasets comprised of the most current version of the same data from various integration sources.  </p>\n\n<p>Daily, we run jobs that compare the production dataset to the live datasets and based on a set of rules we merge the data, purge the live datasets, then start all over again.  The rules are in place because we might trust one source of data more than another for a particular value of a particular class.</p>\n\n<p>The jobs are essentially a series of SQL statements that go row-by-row through each dataset, and field by field within each row.  The common changes are limited to a handful of fields in each row, but since anything can change we compare each value.</p>\n\n<p>There are 10s of millions of rows of data and in some environments the merge jobs can take longer than 24 hours.

Naturally you are trying to build a model that predicts how if a person defaults on their loan.  Lets keep this simple and say that the outcomes are either full payment, or default.</p>\n\n<p>From a business perspective you can sum up a models performance with a contingency matrix:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RgWr9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>When the model predicts someone is going to default, do they?  To determining the downsides of over and under fitting I find it helpful to think of it as an optimization problem, because in each cross section of predicted verses actual model performance there is either a cost or profit to be made:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/78kH2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In this example predicting a default that is a default means avoiding any risk, and predicted a non-default which doesn't default will make $50 per loan issued.  Where things get dicey is when you are wrong, if you default when you predicted non-default you lose the entire loan principal and if you predict default when a customer actually would not have you suffer $50 of missed opportunity.  The numbers here are not important, just the approach.</p>\n\n<p>With this framework we can now begin to understand the difficulties associated with over and under fitting.</p>\n\n<p>Over fitting in this case would mean that your model works far better on you development/test data then it does in production.  Or to put it another way, your model in production will far underperform what you saw in development, this false confidence will probably cause you to take on far more risky loans then you otherwise would and leaves you very vulnerable to losing money.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, under fitting in this context will leave you with a model that just does a poor job of matching reality.  While the results of this can be wildly unpredictable, (the opposite word you want to describe your predictive models), commonly what happens is standards are tightened up to compensate for this, leading to less overall customers leading to lost good customers.  </p>\n\n<p>Under fitting suffers a kind of opposite difficulty that over fitting does, which is under fitting gives you lower confidence.  Insidiously, the lack of predictability still leads you to take on unexpected risk, all of which is bad news.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience the best way to avoid both of these situations is validating your model on data that is completely outside the scope of your training data, so you can have some confidence that you have a representative sample of what you will see \"in the wild\".  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it is always a good practice to revalidate your models periodically, to determine how quickly your model is degrading, and if it is still accomplishing your objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Just to some things up, your model is under fitted when it does a poor job of predicting both the development and production data.</p>\n",

This is especially important for bonds that lack the government guarantee.

Without going into the nitty gritty the basic idea can be illustrated with these sentences:</p>\n\n<p>Text = \"How is the loss of the Viagra patent going to affect Pfizer\", Spam = false\nText = \"Cheap Viagra Buy Now\", Spam = true\nText = \"Online pharmacy Viagra Cialis Lipitor\", Spam = true</p>\n\n<p>For a two stage neural network, the first stage will calculate the likelihood of spam based off of if the word exists in the sentence.  So from our example:</p>\n\n<p>viagra => 66%\nbuy => 100%\nPfizer => 0%\netc..</p>\n\n<p>Then for the second stage the results in the first stage are used as variables in the second stage:</p>\n\n<p>viagra &amp; buy => 100%\nPfizer &amp; viagra=> 0%</p>\n\n<p>This basic idea is run for many of the permutations of the all the words in your training data.  The end results once trained is basically just an equation that based of the context of the words in the sentence can assign a probability of being spam.  Set spamminess threshold, and filter out any data higher then said threshold.</p>\n",

The annotations are stored in a separate .annot file which contain each annotation as well as its location within the original document.  A word of warning though, if you ultimately want to feed the annotations into a classifier like the Stanford NER tool then you will have to do some manipulation to get the data into a format that it will accept.</p>\n",

I would especially pick a format that can be used regardless of development environment and one that can keep some basic structure if that becomes relevant (like tokenization)</p>\n\n<p>It might seem strange, but I would honestly suggest <code>JSON</code>. It's extremely well supported, supports a lot of structure, and is flexible enough that you shouldn't have to move from it for not being powerful enough. For your example, something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{'text': 'I saw the company's manager last day.\", {'Person': [{'name': 'John'}, {'indices': [0:1]}, etc...]}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The one big advantage you've got over any NLP-specific formats here is that <code>JSON</code> can be parsed in any environment, and since you'll probably have to edit your format anyway, JSON lends itself to very simple edits that give you a short distance to other formats.</p>\n\n<p>You can also implicitly store tokenization information if you want:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"text\": [\"I\", \"saw\", \"the\", \"company's\", \"manager\", \"last\", \"day.\"]}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT: To clarify the mapping of metadata is pretty open, but here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{'body': '&lt;some_text&gt;',\n 'metadata': \n  {'&lt;entity&gt;':\n    {'&lt;attribute&gt;': '&lt;value&gt;',\n     'location': [&lt;start_index&gt;, &lt;end_index&gt;]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hope that helps, let me know if you've got any more questions.</p>\n",

There are a large number of reasons for this, but I'm going to build on some of the points that other people have mentioned here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Picking a single language:</strong> It's definitely possible to mix and match languages, picking <code>d3</code> for your visualization needs, <code>FORTRAN</code> for your fast matrix multiplies, and <code>python</code> for all of your networking and scripting. You can do this down the line, but keeping your stack as simple as possible is a good move, especially early on.</li>\n<li><strong>Picking something bigger than you:</strong> You never want to be pushing up against the barriers of the language you want to use. This is a huge issue when it comes to languages like <code>Julia</code> and <code>FORTRAN</code>, which simply don't offer the full functionality of languages like <code>python</code> or <code>R</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Pick Community</strong>: The one most difficult thing to find in any language is community. <code>Python</code> is the clear winner here. If you get stuck, you ask something on SO, and someone will answer in a matter of minutes, which is simply not the case for most other languages. If you're learning something in a vacuum you will simply learn much slower.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In terms of the minus points, I might actually push back on them.</p>\n\n<p>Deepening your knowledge of one language is a decent idea, but knowing <em>only</em> one language, without having practice generalizing that knowledge to other languages is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot. I have changed my entire favored development stack three time over as many years, moving from <code>MATLAB</code> to <code>Java</code> to <code>haskell</code> to <code>python</code>. Learning to transfer your knowledge to another language is far more valuable than just knowing one.</p>\n\n<p>As far as feasibility, this is something you're going to see again and again in any programming career. Turing completeness means you could technically do everything with <code>HTML4</code> and <code>CSS3</code>, but you want to pick the right tool for the job. If you see the ideal tool and decide to leave it by the roadside you're going to find yourself slowed down wishing you had some of the tools you left behind.</p>\n\n<p>A great example of that last point is trying to deploy <code>R</code> code. 'R''s networking capabilities are hugely lacking compared to <code>python</code>, and if you want to deploy a service, or use slightly off-the-beaten path packages, the fact that <code>pip</code> has an order of magnitude more packages than <code>CRAN</code> is a huge help.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<h1>Motivation</h1>\n\n<p>I work with datasets that contain personally identifiable information (PII) and sometimes need to share part of a dataset with third parties, in a way that doesn't expose PII and subject my employer to liability. Our usual approach here is to withhold data entirely, or in some cases to reduce its resolution; e.g., replacing an exact street address with the corresponding county or census tract. </p>\n\n<p>This means that certain types of analysis and processing must be done in-house, even when a third party has resources and expertise more suited to the task. Since the source data is not disclosed, the way we go about this analysis and processing lacks transparency. As a result, any third party's ability to perform QA/QC, adjust parameters or make refinements may be very limited.</p>\n\n<h1>Anonymizing Confidential Data</h1>\n\n<p>One task involves identifying individuals by their names, in user-submitted data, while taking into account errors and inconsistencies. A private individual might be recorded in one place as \"Dave\" and in another as \"David,\" commercial entities can have many different abbreviations, and there are always some typos. I've developed scripts based on a number of criteria that determine when two records with non-identical names represent the same individual, and assign them a common ID. </p>\n\n<p>At this point we can make the dataset anonymous by withholding the names and replacing them with this personal ID number. But this means the recipient has almost no information about e.g. the strength of the match. We would prefer to be able to pass along as much information as possible without divulging identity.</p>\n\n<h1>What Doesn't Work</h1>\n\n<p>For instance, it would be great to be able to encrypt strings while preserving edit distance. This way, third parties could do some of their own QA/QC, or choose to do further processing on their own, without ever accessing (or being able to potentially reverse-engineer) PII. Perhaps we match strings in-house with edit distance &lt;= 2, and the recipient wants to look at the implications of tightening that tolerance to edit distance &lt;= 1.</p>\n\n<p>But the only method I am familiar with that does this is ROT13, which hardly even counts as encryption; it's like writing the names upside down and saying, \"promise you won't flip the paper over?\"</p>\n\n<p>Another <strong>bad</strong> solution would be to abbreviate everything. \"Ellen Roberts\" becomes \"ER\" and so forth. This is a poor solution because in some cases the initials, in association with public data, will reveal a person's identity, and in other cases it's too ambiguous; \"Benjamin Othello Ames\" and \"Bank of America\" will have the same initials, but their names are otherwise dissimilar. So it doesn't do either of the things we want.</p>\n\n<p>An inelegant alternative is to introduce additional fields to track certain attributes of the name, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| Row | ID | Name              | WordChars | Origin |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 1   | 17 | \"AMELIA BEDELIA\"  | (6, 7)    | Eng    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 2   | 18 | \"CHRISTOPH BAUER\" | (9, 5)    | Ger    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 3   | 18 | \"C J BAUER\"       | (1, 1, 5) | Ger    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n| 4   | 19 | \"FRANZ HELLER\"    | (5, 6)    | Ger    |\n+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I call this \"inelegant\" because it requires anticipating which qualities might be interesting and it's relatively coarse. If the names are removed, there's not much you can reasonably conclude about the strength of the match between rows 2 &amp; 3, or about the distance between rows 2 &amp; 4 (i.e., how close they are to matching).</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>The goal is to transform strings in such a way that as many useful qualities of the original string are preserved as possible while obscuring the original string. Decryption should be impossible, or so impractical as to be effectively impossible, no matter the size of the data set. In particular, a method that preserves the edit distance between arbitrary strings would be very useful.</p>\n\n<p>I've found a couple papers that might be relevant, but they're a bit over my head:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2010-109.pdf\">Privacy Preserving String Comparisons Based on Levenshtein Distance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf\">An Empirical Comparison of Approaches to Approximate String \nMatching in Private Record Linkage</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Feature extraction usually involves generating new features which are composites of existing features. Both of these techniques fall into the category of feature engineering.

Generally, I have a relatively short list of qualifications I look for when it comes to any tool in this space. In no particular order they are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Basically boils down to how quickly the language does matrix multiplication, as that is more or less the most important task in data science.</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: At least for me personally, this comes down to ease of building a distributed system. This is somewhere where languages like <code>Julia</code> really shine.</li>\n<li><strong>Community</strong>: With any language, you're really looking for an active community that can help you when you get stuck using whichever tool you're using. This is where <code>python</code> pulls very far ahead of most other languages. </li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Nothing is worse than being limited by the language that you use. It doesn't happen very often, but trying to represent graph structures in <code>haskell</code> is a notorious pain, and <code>Julia</code> is filled with a lot of code architectures pains as a result of being such a young language.</li>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: If you want to use something in a larger environment, you want to make sure that setup is a straightforward and it can be automated. Nothing is worse than having to set up a finnicky build on half a dozen machines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a ton of articles out there about performance and scalability, but in general you're going to be looking at a performance differential of maybe 5-10x between languages, which may or may not matter depending on your specific application. As far as GPU acceleration goes, <code>cudamat</code> is a really seamless way of getting it working with <code>python</code>, and the <code>cuda</code> library in general has made GPU acceleration far more accessible than it used to be.</p>\n\n<p>The two primary metrics I use for both community and flexibility are to look at the language's package manager, and the language questions on a site like SO. If there are a large number of high-quality questions and answers, it's a good sign that the community is active. Number of packages and the general activity on those packages can also be a good proxy for this metric.</p>\n\n<p>As far as ease of use goes, I am a firm believer that the only way to actually know is to actually set it up yourself. There's a lot of superstition around a lot of Data Science tools, specifically things like databases and distributed computing architecture, but there's no way to really know if something is easy or hard to setup up and deploy without just building it yourself.</p>\n",

If you want to use them in commercial products, you need to ourchase a licence:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_Recipes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_Recipes</a></p>\n\n<p>Most of the time performance will not be the issue but finding the right algorithms and parameters for them, so it is important to have a fast scripting language instead of a monster program that first needs to compile 10 mins before calculating two numbers and putting out the result.</p>\n\n<p>And a big plus in using R is that it has built-in functions or libraries for almost any kind of diagram you might wanna need to visualize your data.</p>\n\n<p>If you then have a working version, it is almost easy to port it to any other language you think is more performant.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>One of the references I mentioned in the OP led me to a potential solution that seems quite powerful, described in \"Privacy-preserving record linkage using Bloom filters\" (<a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/41\" rel=\"nofollow\">doi:10.1186/1472-6947-9-41</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new protocol for privacy-preserving record linkage with encrypted identifiers allowing for errors in identifiers has been developed. The protocol is based on Bloom filters on q-grams of identifiers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article goes into detail about the method, which I will summarize here to the best of my ability.</p>\n\n<p>A Bloom filter is a fixed-length series of bits storing the results of a fixed set of independent hash functions, each computed on the same input value. The output of each hash function should be an index value from among the possible indexes in the filter; i.e., if you have a 0-indexed series of 10 bits, hash functions should return (or be mapped to) values from 0 to 9. </p>\n\n<p>The filter starts with each bit set to 0. After hashing the input value with each function from the set of hash functions, each bit corresponding to an index value returned by any hash function is set to 1. If the same index is returned by more than one hash function, the bit at that index is only set once. You could consider the Bloom filter to be a superposition of the set of hashes onto the fixed range of bits.</p>\n\n<p>The protocol described in the above-linked article divides strings into n-grams, which are in this case sets of characters. As an example, <code>\"hello\"</code> might yield the following set of 2-grams:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\"_h\", \"he\", \"el\", \"ll\", \"lo\", \"o_\"]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Padding the front and back with spaces seems to be generally optional when constructing n-grams; the examples given in the paper that proposes this method use such padding.</p>\n\n<p>Each n-gram can be hashed to produce a Bloom filter, and this set of Bloom filters can be superimposed on itself (bitwise OR operation) to produce the Bloom filter for the string.</p>\n\n<p>If the filter contains many more bits than there are hash functions or n-grams, arbitrary strings are relatively unlikely to produce exactly the same filter. However, the more n-grams two strings have in common, the more bits their filters will ultimately share. You can then compare any two filters <code>A, B</code> by means of their Dice coefficient:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>D<sub>A, B</sub> = 2h / (a + b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where <code>h</code> is the number of bits that are set to 1 in both filters, <code>a</code> is the number of bits set to 1 in <em>only</em> filter A, and <code>b</code> is the number of bits set to 1 in <em>only</em> filter B. If the strings are exactly the same, the Dice coefficient will be 1; the more they differ, the closer the coefficient will be to <code>0</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Because the hash functions are mapping an indeterminate number of unique inputs to a small number of possible bit indexes, different inputs may produce the same filter, so the coefficient indicates only a <em>probability</em> that the strings are the same or similar. The number of different hash functions and the number of bits in the filter are important parameters for determining the likelihood of false positives - pairs of inputs that are much less similar than the Dice coefficient produced by this method predicts.</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this tutorial</a> to be very helpful for understanding the Bloom filter.</p>\n\n<p>There is some flexibility in the implementation of this method; see also <a href=\"https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this 2010 paper</a> (also linked at the end of the question) for some indications of how performant it is in relation to other methods, and with various parameters.</p>\n",

Because Spark runs on/with Hadoop, which is rather the point.</p>\n\n<p>The primary reason to use Spark is for speed, and this comes from the fact that its execution can keep data in memory between stages rather than always persist back to HDFS after a Map or Reduce. This advantage is very pronounced for iterative computations, which have tens of stages each of which is touching the same data. This is where things might be \"100x\" faster. For simple, one-pass ETL-like jobs for which MapReduce was designed, it's not in general faster.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason to use Spark is its nicer high-level language compared to MapReduce. It provides a functional programming-like view that mimics Scala, which is far nicer than writing MapReduce code. (Although you have to either use Scala, or adopt the slightly-less-developed Java or Python APIs for Spark). <a href=\"http://crunch.apache.org\">Crunch</a> and <a href=\"http://cascading.org\">Cascading</a> already provide a similar abstraction on top of MapReduce, but this is still an area where Spark is nice.</p>\n\n<p>Finally Spark has as-yet-young but promising subprojects for ML, graph analysis, and streaming, which expose a similar, coherent API.

The two may not be optimally integrated yet. For example until recently I don't think Spark could ask YARN for allocations based on number of cores?

Group <code>A</code> intends to buy and group <code>B</code> intends to sell a determined product <code>X</code>. The product has a series of attributes <code>x_i</code>, and my objective is to facilitate the transaction between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> by matching their preferences. The main idea is to point out to each member of <code>A</code> a corresponding in <code>B</code> whose product better suits his needs, and vice versa. </p>\n\n<p>Some complicating aspects of the problem:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The list of attributes is not finite. The buyer might be interested in a very particular characteristic or some kind of design, which is rare among the population and I can't predict. Can't previously list all the attributes;</p></li>\n<li><p>Attributes might be continuous, binary or non-quantifiable (ex: price, functionality, design);</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any suggestion on how to approach this problem and solve it in an automated way? The idea is to really think out of the box here, so feel free to \"go wild\" on your suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>I would also appreciate some references to other similar problems if possible. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Great suggestions! Many similarities in to the way I’m thinking of approaching the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue on mapping the attributes is that the level of detail to which the product should be described depends on each buyers. Let’s take an example of a car. The product “car” has lots and lots of attributes that range from its performance, mechanical structure, price etc.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I just want a cheap car, or an electric car. Ok, that’s easy to map because they represent main features of this product. But let’s say, for instance, that I want a car with Dual-Clutch transmission or Xenon headlights. Well there might be many cars on the data base with this attributes but I wouldn’t ask the seller to fill in this level of detail to their product prior to the information that there is someone looking them.  Such a procedure would require every seller fill a complex, very detailed, form just try to sell his car on the platform. Just wouldn’t work. </p>\n\n<p>But still, my challenge is to try to be as detailed as necessary in the search to make a good match. So the way I’m thinking is mapping main aspects of the product, those that are probably relevant to everyone, to narrow down de group of potential sellers.\nNext step would be a “refined search”. In order to avoid creating a too detailed form I could ask buyers and sellers to write a free text of their specification. And then use some word matching algorithm to find possible matches. Although I understand that this is not a proper solution to the problem because the seller cannot “guess” what the buyer needs.  But might get me close.  </p>\n\n<p>The weighting criteria suggested is great.  It allows me to quantify the level to which the seller matches the buyer’s needs.  The scaling part might be a problem though, because the importance of each attribute varies from client to client. I’m thinking of using some kind of pattern recognition or just asking de buyer to input the level of importance of each attribute. </p>\n\n<p>I’m not a native English speaker so hope I’m being able to express my ideas properly. </p>\n",

A standard and intuitive approach is to represent each attribute as an individual dimension in a vector space. Each product is then simply a point in this space. In that case, if you want to dynamically add more attributes you simply have to remap the product vectors into the new feature space (with additional dimensions).    </p>\n\n<p>With this representation, a seller is a point in the feature space with product attributes and a buyer is a point in the same feature space with the preference attributes.

Index the set of sellers (i.e. the product attributes) by treating each attribute as a separate term with the term-weight being set to the attribute value. A query in this case is a buyer which is also encoded in the term space as a query vector with appropriate term weights.

That is, instead of taking data and fitting a model, I'm going to start with the model in order to show how this is truly a regression problem.</p>\n\n<p>In logistic regression, we are modeling the log odds, or logit, that an event occurs, which is a continuous quantity. If the probability that event A occurs is P(A), the odds are:</p>\n\n<p>P(A) / (1 - P(A)) </p>\n\n<p>The log odds, then, are:</p>\n\n<p>log { (P(A) / (1 - P(A))) }</p>\n\n<p>As in linear regression, we model this with a linear combination of coefficients and predictors:</p>\n\n<p>logit = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 ...</p>\n\n<p>Imagine we are given a model of whether a person has gray hair. Our model uses age as the only predictor. Here, our event A = a person has gray hair:</p>\n\n<p>log odds of gray hair = -10 + 0.25 * age</p>\n\n<p>...Regression! Here is some Python code and a plot:</p>\n\n<pre><code>%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 100, 100)\n\ndef log_odds(x):\n    return -10 + .25 * x\n\nplt.plot(x, log_odds(x))\nplt.xlabel(\"age\")\nplt.ylabel(\"log odds of gray hair\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xR0OT.png\" alt=\"plot of the log odds for our toy example\"></p>\n\n<p>Now, let's make it a classifier. First, we need to transform the log odds to get out our probability P(A). We can use the sigmoid function:</p>\n\n<p>P(A) = 1 / (1 + exp(-log odds))</p>\n\n<p>Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plt.plot(x, 1 / (1 + np.exp(-log_odds(x))))\nplt.xlabel(\"age\")\nplt.ylabel(\"probability of gray hair\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hSpCa.png\" alt=\"plot of the probability of gray hair for our toy example\"></p>\n\n<p>The last thing we need to make this a classifier is to add a decision rule. One very common rule is to classify a success whenever P(A) > 0.5. We will adopt that rule, which implies that our classifier will predict gray hair whenever a person is older than 40 and will predict non-gray hair whenever a person is under 40.</p>\n\n<p>Logistic regression works great as a classifier in more realistic examples too, but before it can be a classifier, it must be a regression technique!</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>As suggested, <strong>going wild</strong>. First of all, correct me if I’m wrong:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Just a few features exist for each unique product;</li>\n<li>There is no ultimate features list, and clients are able to add new features to their products.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If so, constructing full product-feature table could be computational expensive. And final data table would be extremely sparse.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is narrowing customers (products) list for matching. Let’s build a bipartite graph, where sellers would be type-1 nodes, and buyers would be type-2 nodes. Create an edge between any seller and buyer every time they reference a similar product feature, as in the following sketch:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q1JTN.png\" alt=\"graph\"></p>\n\n<p>Using the above graph, for every unique seller’s product you can select only buyers who are interested in features that match the product (it’s possible to filter <strong>at least one</strong> common feature, match the full set of features, or set a threshold level). But certainly, that’s not enough. The next step is to compare feature values, as described by the seller and buyer. There are a lot of variants (e.g., k-Nearest-Neighbors). But why not try to solve this question using the existing graph? Let’s add weights to the edges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>for continuous features (e.g., price): </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Cprice_%7Bsell%7D%20-%20price_%7Bbuy%7D%7C%7D%7B%5Cmax%28price%29%20-%20%5Cmin%28price%29%7D\" alt=\"price_weight\"></p></li>\n<li><p>for binary and non-quantifiable features - just logical biconditional:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20feature_%7Bsell%7D%20%5Cleftrightarrow%20feature_%7Bbuy%7D\" alt=\"feature_weight\"></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The main idea here is to <strong>scale</strong> every feature to the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>. Additionally, we can use feature coefficients to determine most important features. E.g., assuming price is twice as important as availability of some rare function: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=adj.price.weight%20%3D%202%20%5Ctimes%20price.weight\" alt=\"adj_w_1\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=adj.feature.weight%20%3D%201%20%5Ctimes%20feature.weight\" alt=\"adj_w_2\"></p>\n\n<p>One of the final steps is simplifying the graph structure and reducing many edges to one edge with weight equal to the sum of the previously calculated weights of each feature. With such a reduced structure every pair of customers/products could have only one edge (no parallel edges). So, to find the best deal for exact seller you just need to select connected buyers with max weighted edges.</p>\n\n<p>Future challenge: introduce a cheap method for weighting edges on first step :)</p>\n",

For example, if user <code>bbb</code> is in your concatenated table five times, then you know that person made your list all five months.</p>\n\n<p>To answer you second question, you could do a <code>group by</code> operation to compute some aggregate function of the users. A <code>group by</code> operation with an average function is a little crude and sensitive to outliers, but it would probably get you close to what you are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility for the third question is to compute the difference in threat score between month <code>n-1</code> and month <code>n</code>. That is, for each month (not including the first month) you subtract the user's previous threat score from the current threat score. You can make this a new column so your table would now look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>User-id | Threat_score | month | difference\naaa       45             1       null\nbbb       32             1       null\nccc       20             1       null\n...       ...            ...     ...\nbbb       64             2       32\nccc       29             2       9\n...       ...            ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this table, you could again do a <code>group by</code> operation to find people who consistently have a higher threat score than the previous month or you could simply find people with a large difference between the current month and the previous month.</p>\n\n<p>As you suggest, visualizing this data is a really good idea. If you care about these threat scores over time (which I think you do), I strongly recommend a simple line chart, with month on the x-axis and threat score on the y-axis. It's not fancy, but it's extremely easy to interpret and should give you useful information about the trends.</p>\n\n<p>Most of this stuff (not the visualization) can be done in SQL and all of it can be done in R or Python (and many other languages).

For SQL, you would further qualify your query based on a minimum risk score value.</p>\n\n<p>In excel, a straight pivot isn't going to work, you'll have to copy the unique values in one column to another, then drag a CountIf function adjacent to each unique value, qualifying the countif function with a minimum risk score.</p>\n\n<p>question 3.

I'm not particularly partial to any of them.</p>\n\n<p>If I needed to trend threshold values over time, I'd output the results for all people into a second table add records to that table each month.</p>\n\n<p>If I just needed to do it once or twice, figuring out how to do it in excel by adding a new column using VLookUp and some basic math and a filter would probably be the fastest and easiest way to get it done.  I tend to avoid using excel for things I'll need to use with consistency because there are limits that you run into when your data gets sizeable.</p>\n",

Over the next week, you see on average 125 customers a day.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next few months, you again decide that you want to get some more business, and perhaps sustain it a bit longer, so you try some other random things to get more customers in your store.

Each client has websites ranging in size from 5 pages to well over 1 million. Over the course of the past 5 year, each agency has annotated all of their work for each client, including the type of work that was done, the number of webpages on a website that were influenced, the number of hours spent, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Using the above data, which I have assembled into a data warehouse (placed into a bunch of star/snowflake schemas), I need to determine how likely it was that any one piece of work (any one event in time) had an impact on the traffic hitting any/all pages influenced by a specific piece of work. I have created models for 40 different types of content that are found on a website that describes the typical traffic pattern a page with said content type might experience from launch date until present. Normalized relative to the appropriate model, I need to determine the highest and lowest number of increased or decreased visitors a specific page received as the result of a specific piece of work.</p>\n\n<p>While I have experience with basic data analysis (linear and multiple regression, correlation, etc), I am at a loss for how to approach solving this problem. Whereas in the past I have typically analyzed data with multiple measurements for a given axis (for example temperature vs thirst vs animal and determined the impact on thirst that increased temperate has across animals), I feel that above, I am attempting to analyze the impact of a single event at some point in time for a non-linear, but predictable (or at least model-able), longitudinal dataset. I am stumped :(</p>\n\n<p>Any help, tips, pointers, recommendations, or directions would be extremely helpful and I would be eternally grateful!</p>\n",

So, from a statistical perspective, a model is assumed and given various assumptions the errors are treated and the model parameters and other questions are inferred. </p>\n\n<p>Machine learning comes from a computer science perspective. The models are algorithmic and usually very few assumptions are required regarding the data. We work with hypothesis space and learning bias. The best exposition of machine learning I found is contained in Tom Mitchell's book called <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html\">Machine Learning</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For a more exhaustive and complete idea regarding the two cultures you can read the Leo Broiman paper called <a href=\"http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http://strimmerlab.org/courses/ss09/current-topics/download/breiman2001.pdf&amp;ei=RQGkU_DgH8Le7AaRmID4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNnrlqadmBT2fZMT_NfoUQ1rEuow&amp;sig2=g5qovUTsuuJUGGE64g0nrQ\">Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures</a></p>\n\n<p>However what must be added is that even if the two sciences started with different perspectives, both of them now now share a fair amount of common knowledge and techniques. Why, because the problems were the same, but the tools were different. So now machine learning is mostly treated from a statistical perspective (check the Hastie,Tibshirani, Friedman book <a href=\"http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/\">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> from a machine learning point of view with a statistical treatement, and perhaps Kevin P. Murphy 's book <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-2\">Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective</a>, to name just a few of the best books available today). </p>\n\n<p>Even the history of the development of this field show the benefits of this merge of perspectives. I will describe two events. </p>\n\n<p>The first is the creation of CART trees, which was created by Breiman with a solid statistical background. At approximately the same time, Quinlan developed ID3,C45,See5, and so on, decision tree suite with a more computer science background. Now both this families of trees and the ensemble methods like bagging and forests become quite similar. </p>\n\n<p>The second story is about boosting. Initially they were developed by Freund and Shapire when they discovered AdaBoost. The choices for designing AdaBoost were done mostly from a computational perspective. Even the authors did not understood well why it works. Only 5 years later Breiman (again!) described the adaboost model from a statistical perspective and gave an explanation for why that works. Since then, various eminent scientists, with both type of backgrounds, developed further those ideas leading to a Pleiads of boosting algorithms, like logistic boosting, gradient boosting, gentle boosting ans so on. It is hard now to think at boosting without a solid statistical background.</p>\n\n<p>GLM is a statistical development. However new Bayesian treatments puts this algorithm also in machine learning playground. So I believe both claims could be right, since the interpretation and treatment of how it works could be different. </p>\n",

I hope we get a bunch of real world examples of data problems and several perspectives on how best to solve them.</p>\n\n<p>I would encourage you <em>not</em> to use p-values as they can be pretty misleading (<a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2013/03/12/misunderstanding-the-p-value/\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/boboh/2008/08/19/why_p_values_are_evil/\">2</a>). My approach hinges on you being able to summarize traffic on a given page before and after some intervention. What you care about is the difference in the <em>rate</em> before and after the intervention. That is, how does the number of hits per day change? Below, I explain a first stab approach with some simulated example data. I will then explain one potential pitfall (and what I would do about it).</p>\n\n<p>First, let's think about one page before and after an intervention. Pretend the intervention increases hits per day by roughly 15%:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndef simulate_data(true_diff=0):\n    #First choose a number of days between [1, 1000] before the intervention\n    num_before = np.random.randint(1, 1001)\n\n    #Next choose a number of days between [1, 1000] after the intervention\n    num_after = np.random.randint(1, 1001)\n\n    #Next choose a rate for before the intervention. How many views per day on average?\n    rate_before = np.random.randint(50, 151)\n\n    #The intervention causes a `true_diff` increase on average (but is also random)\n    rate_after = np.random.normal(1 + true_diff, .1) * rate_before\n\n    #Simulate viewers per day:\n    vpd_before = np.random.poisson(rate_before, size=num_before)\n    vpd_after = np.random.poisson(rate_after, size=num_after)\n\n    return vpd_before, vpd_after\n\nvpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)\n\nplt.hist(vpd_before, histtype=\"step\", bins=20, normed=True, lw=2)\nplt.hist(vpd_after, histtype=\"step\", bins=20, normed=True, lw=2)\nplt.legend((\"before\", \"after\"))\nplt.title(\"Views per day before and after intervention\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Views per day\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.show()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FJJqD.png\" alt=\"Distribution of hits per day before and after the intervention\"></p>\n\n<p>We can clearly see that the intervention increased the number of hits per day, on average. But in order to quantify the difference in rates, we should use one company's intervention for multiple pages. Since the underlying rate will be different for each page, we should compute the percent change in rate (again, the rate here is hits per day).</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's pretend we have data for <code>n = 100</code> pages, each of which received an intervention from the same company. To get the percent difference we take (mean(hits per day before) - mean(hits per day after)) / mean(hits per day before):</p>\n\n<pre><code>n = 100\n\npct_diff = np.zeros(n)\n\nfor i in xrange(n):\n    vpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)\n    # % difference. Note: this is the thing we want to infer\n    pct_diff[i] = (vpd_after.mean() - vpd_before.mean()) / vpd_before.mean()\n\nplt.hist(pct_diff)\nplt.title(\"Distribution of percent change\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Percent change\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.show()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CAitf.png\" alt=\"Distribution of percent change\"></p>\n\n<p>Now we have the distribution of our parameter of interest! We can query this result in different ways. For example, we might want to know the mode, or (approximation of) the most likely value for this percent change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def mode_continuous(x, num_bins=None):\n    if num_bins is None:\n        counts, bins = np.histogram(x)\n    else:\n        counts, bins = np.histogram(x, bins=num_bins)\n\n    ndx = np.argmax(counts)\n    return bins[ndx:(ndx+1)].mean()\n\nmode_continuous(pct_diff, 20)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I ran this I got 0.126, which is not bad, considering our true percent change is 15. We can also see the number of positive changes, which approximates the probability that a given company's intervention improves hits per day:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(pct_diff &gt; 0).mean()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, my result is 0.93, so we could say there's a pretty good chance that this company is effective.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a potential pitfall: Each page probably has some underlying trend that you should probably account for. That is, even without the intervention, hits per day may increase. To account for this, I would estimate a simple linear regression where the outcome variable is hits per day and the independent variable is day (start at day=0 and simply increment for all the days in your sample). Then subtract the estimate, y_hat, from each number of hits per day to de-trend your data. Then you can do the above procedure and be confident that a positive percent difference is not due to the underlying trend. Of course, the trend may not be linear, so use discretion! Good luck!</p>\n",

Basically, everyone in marketing would come up with a crazy idea that the sold to higher ups as the single event that would boost KPI's by 2000%.  The higher ups would approve them and then they would begin their \"test\".  Results would come back, and management would dump it on the data analysts to determine what worked and who did it.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is you cant really know if it wasn't run as a random A/B style test on like time periods.  But I am very aware of how deficient that answer is, especially if the fact that a pure answer doesn't exist is irrelevant to the urgency of future business decisions.  Here are some of the techniques I would use to salvage the analysis in this situation, bear in mind this is more of an art then a science.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Handles</strong></p>\n\n<p>A handle is something that exists in the data that you can hold onto.  From what you are telling me in your situation you have a lot of info on who the marketing agency is, when they tried a tactic, and to which site they applied it to.  These are your starting point and information like this going to be the corner stone of your analysis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>\n\n<p>The methodology is going to probably hold the strongest impact on which agencies are given credit for any and all gains so you are going to need to make sure that it is clearly outlines and all stake holders agree that it makes sense.  If you cant do that it is going to be difficult for people to trust your analysis.  </p>\n\n<p>An example of this are conversions. Say the marketing department purchases some leads and they arrive at our landing page, we would track them for 3 days, if they made a purchase within that time we would count them as having been converted.  Why 3 days, why not 5 or 1?  Thats not important as long as everyone agrees, you now have a definition you can build off of.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Comparisons</strong></p>\n\n<p>In an ideal would you would have a nice A/B test to prove a definitive relationship, I am going to assume that you are running short on those, still, you can learn something from a simple comparison of like data.  When companies are trying to determine the efficacy of radio advertising they will often run ads on offset months in the same market, or for several months in one market and compare that with the results in a separate but similar market.  Its doesn't pass for science, but even with all that noise a strong results will almost always be noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>I would combine these in your case to determine how long an event is given to register an effect.  Once you have the data from that time period run it against your modeled out traffic prediction, week over week growth, month over month etc. Which, can then allow a meaningful comparison between agencies, and across time periods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pragmatism</strong></p>\n\n<p>The aspiration is to be able to provide a deep understanding of cause and effect, but it is probably not realistic.  Because of how messy outside factors make your analysis, you are constantly going to run up against the question over and over again: Did this event raise volume/sales/click throughs, or would doing anything at all have had the same effect?  The best advise I can give for this is set very realistic goals for what you are looking to measure.  A good starting point is, within the methodology you have, which event had the largest impact.  Once you have those open your aperture from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once you have reasoned out all of these aspects you can go about building a general solution which can then be automated.  The advantage to designing your solution in this manner is that the business logic is already built in.  This will make your results much more approachable and intuitive to non-technical business leaders.</p>\n",

The way I'd approach the problem is to apply a standard discriminative classification approach such as SVM.</p>\n\n<p>In a discriminative classification approach the notion of similarity or inverse distance between data points (documents in this case) is pivotal. Fortunately for documents, there is a standard way of defining pairwise similarity. This is the standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity\" rel=\"nofollow\">cosine similarity</a> measure which makes use of document length normalization to take different document lengths into account.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, practically speaking, in cosine similarity you would work with relative term weights normalized by document lengths and hence document length diversity should not be a major issue in the similarity computation.</p>\n\n<p>One also has to be careful when applying idf in term weights. If the number of documents is not significantly large the idf measure may be statistically imprecise thus adding noise to the term weights. It's also a standard practice to ignore stopwords and punctuations.</p>\n",

This is an important parameter for back-propagation. </p>\n\n<p>For estimating your model parameters, as user tomaskazemekas pointed out, plotting Learning Curves is a very good approach. In addition to that, you could also create a plot using a model parameter (e.g. training epochs or hidden layer size) vs. Training and Validation error. This will allow you to understand the bias/variance tradeoff, and help you pick a good value for your parameters. <a href=\"http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/practical.html#cross-validation-and-testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some info can be found here</a>. Naturally, it is a good idea to keep a small percentage of your data for a (third) Test set.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, it seems that increasing the number of neurons in your model show no significant improvement for your RMSE. This suggests that you could also try with a simpler model, i.e. with less neurons and see how your model behaves.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I would suggest (if you haven't done so already) trying a simple model with few or no parameters first e.g. Linear Regression, and compare your results with the literature, just as a sanity check. </p>\n",

Any scientists who claim that their work is entirely objective and rational are in denial about the nature of science; every single model we create is informed by our biases and perspectives. The key is that we each have different biases and perspectives, which is one reason that science is the pursuit of a society, not of individuals, and underscores the importance of peer review.</p>\n\n<p>You have already identified some trade-offs between an algorithmic solution and individual/case-by-case corrections. If we have training as scientists, we may be used to thinking that everything has to be applied as an overall rule, so we may bend over backwards to find correlations and fit curves to data that just won't reasonably accept it. Applying an algorithm to the entire data set can be powerful when it works, but it's not the only tool at your disposal. Sometimes you need to use your judgment as the scientist.</p>\n\n<p>But, if you use your individual judgment to make exceptions and to manually correct your data, be prepared to defend your judgment and argue your case. Be prepared to show that you considered all the data. If you're going to manually correct 8 observations out of a set of 100,000, you need to do more than justify those 8 manual corrections - you also need to justify <strong>not</strong> correcting the other 99,992 observations.</p>\n\n<p>You can still take a methodical approach, perhaps by classifying your data in a systematic way, and choosing which subset of the data to apply your cleaning algorithm to based on that system of classification. And when you do this, you document it, you make your case, and you respect the judgment of your colleagues in the field.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, why do all this extra work before you know it's necessary? Plenty of \"dirty\" data sets will still produce useful results. Perhaps 0.5% of your data is \"dirty\" in a way that you know will have a bad influence on your end product. Well, any analysis is subject to error, and the more you obsess over that 0.5% the more you will start to think of it and treat it like it was 5%, or 25% - much more significant than it truly is. Try to apply your analysis while admitting you know there is some error, and only do extra work to clean the data once you can show for certain that your analysis fails or is not useful otherwise.</p>\n\n<h2>For example...</h2>\n\n<p>Say you have a set of test results from a survey of wells, showing the concentrations of certain dissolved substances, hourly over the course of a year. And you observe in this set certain spikes, of short duration, and orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding data. If they are few, and obvious, and you know that the sensors used to produce the data set occasionally malfunction, then there's no reason to apply an algorithmic solution to the entire data set. You have a choice between excluding some data or modifying it. </p>\n\n<p>I recommend the exclusion route whenever possible, since you are making fewer assumptions when you don't have to additionally choose a \"correct\" value. But if your analysis will absolutely fail with a discontinuity, there are many options. You could choose to replace \"bad\" values via linear interpolation. You could hold constant the previous value. If there is some great previous literature to apply, and you really have a strong case that the \"bad\" data is purely due to equipment malfunction, perhaps there's an established model that you can apply to fill in those regions.</p>\n\n<p>There are a great many approaches, which is why the most important thing is to document your process, explicitly and exhaustively. Arguing your case is important too, but not strictly necessary; the community is just more likely to ignore you if you don't make a full effort to engage the review process.</p>\n",

You can use a bunch of different technics to complete this task, but my vote is for simplest ones (KISS, yes). E.g., in my case, for age prediction, mean of ego-network users' ages gave satisfactory results (for about 70% of users error was less than +/-3 years, in my case it was enough). It's just an idea, but you can try to use for age prediction weighted average, defining weight as similarity measure between visited sites sets of current user and others.</li>\n<li>Evaluating prediction quality. Algorithm from task-1 will produce prediction almost in all cases. And second task is to determine, if prediction is reliable. E.g., in case of ego network and age prediction: can we trust in prediction, if a user has only one 'friend' in his ego network? This task is more about machine-learning: it's a binary classification problem. You need to compose features set, form training and test samples from your data with both right and wrong predictions. Creating appropriate classifier will help you to filter out unpredictable users. But you need to determine, what are your features set.

                "_Body": "<h1>Do you need a VM?</h1>\n\n<p>You need to keep in mind that a virtual machine is a software emulation of your own or another machine hardware configuration that can run an operating systems. In most basic terms, it acts as a layer interfacing between the virtual OS, and your own OS which then communicates with the lower level hardware to provide support to the virtual OS. What this means for you is:</p>\n\n<h1>Cons</h1>\n\n<h3>Hardware Support</h3>\n\n<p>A drawback of virtual machine technology is that it supports only the hardware that both the virtual machine hypervisor and the guest operating system support. Even if the guest operating system supports the physical hardware, it sees only the virtual hardware presented by the virtual machine. \nThe second aspect of virtual machine hardware support is the hardware presented to the guest operating system. No matter the hardware in the host, the hardware presented to the guest environment is usually the same (with the exception of the CPU, which shows through). For example, VMware GSX Server presents an AMD PCnet32 Fast Ethernet card or an optimized VMware-proprietary network card, depending on which you choose. The network card in the host machine does not matter. VMware GSX Server performs the translation between the guest environment's network card and the host environment's network card. This is great for standardization, but it also means that host hardware that VMware does not understand will not be present in the guest environment.</p>\n\n<h3>Performance Penalty</h3>\n\n<p>Virtual machine technology imposes a performance penalty from running an additional layer above the physical hardware but beneath the guest operating system. The performance penalty varies based on the virtualization software used and the guest software being run. This is significant.</p>\n\n<h1>Pros</h1>\n\n<h3>Isolation</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the key reasons to employ virtualization is to isolate applications from each other. Running everything on one machine would be great if it all worked, but many times it results in undesirable interactions or even outright conflicts. The cause often is software problems or business requirements, such as the need for isolated security. Virtual machines allow you to isolate each application (or group of applications) in its own sandbox environment. The virtual machines can run on the same physical machine (simplifying IT hardware management), yet appear as independent machines to the software you are running. For all intents and purposes—except performance, the virtual machines are independent machines. If one virtual machine goes down due to application or operating system error, the others continue running, providing services your business needs to function smoothly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Standardization</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another key benefit virtual machines provide is standardization. The hardware that is presented to the guest operating system is uniform for the most part, usually with the CPU being the only component that is \"pass-through\" in the sense that the guest sees what is on the host. A standardized hardware platform reduces support costs and increases the share of IT resources that you can devote to accomplishing goals that give your business a competitive advantage. The host machines can be different (as indeed they often are when hardware is acquired at different times), but the virtual machines will appear to be the same across all of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Ease of Testing</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Virtual machines let you test scenarios easily. Most virtual machine software today provides snapshot and rollback capabilities. This means you can stop a virtual machine, create a snapshot, perform more operations in the virtual machine, and then roll back again and again until you have finished your testing. This is very handy for software development, but it is also useful for system administration. Admins can snapshot a system and install some software or make some configuration changes that they suspect may destabilize the system. If the software installs or changes work, then the admin can commit the updates. If the updates damage or destroy the system, the admin can roll them back.\n  Virtual machines also facilitate scenario testing by enabling virtual networks. In VMware Workstation, for example, you can set up multiple virtual machines on a virtual network with configurable parameters, such as packet loss from congestion and latency. You can thus test timing-sensitive or load-sensitive applications to see how they perform under the stress of a simulated heavy workload.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Mobility</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Virtual machines are easy to move between physical machines. Most of the virtual machine software on the market today stores a whole disk in the guest environment as a single file in the host environment. Snapshot and rollback capabilities are implemented by storing the change in state in a separate file in the host information. Having a single file represent an entire guest environment disk promotes the mobility of virtual machines. Transferring the virtual machine to another physical machine is as easy as moving the virtual disk file and some configuration files to the other physical machine. Deploying another copy of a virtual machine is the same as transferring a virtual machine, except that instead of moving the files, you copy them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Which VM should I use if I am starting out?</h1>\n\n<p>The Data Science Box or the Data Science Toolbox are your best bets if you just getting into data science. They have the basic software that you will need, with the primary difference being the virtual environment in which each of these can run. The DSB can run on AWS while the DST can run on Virtual Box (which is the most common tool used for VMs).</p>\n\n<h1>Sources</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I have already read some papers and done some experiments but without much luck. I would like to get advice from EXPERTS to make this work.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I did so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I got tick by tick data for the month of july 2013. It has bid/ask/bid volume/ask volume.</li>\n<li>Extracted all ticks for the time frame 12PM to 14PM for all days.</li>\n<li>From this data, created a data set where each entry consists of n bid values in sequence. </li>\n<li>Used that data to train an ANN with n-1 inputs and the output is the forecasted nth bid value.</li>\n<li>The ANN had n-1 inputs neurons, (n-1)*2 + 1 hidden and 1 output neuron. Input layer had linear TF, hidden had log TF and output had linear TF.</li>\n<li>Trained the network with back propagation with n-125 first and then 10.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For both n, the MSE did not drop below 0.5 and stayed at that value during full training. Assuming that this could be due to the time series being totally random, I used the R package to find partial autocorrelation on the data set (pacf). This gave non zero values for 2 and 3 lags only. </p>\n\n<p>Question 1: What does this mean exactly? </p>\n\n<p>Then I used hurst exponent to evaluate the randomness. In R, hurst(values) showed values above 0.9.</p>\n\n<p>Question 2: It is supposed to be nearly random. Should it have a value closer to 0.5?</p>\n\n<p>I repeated the training of the ANN with n=3. The ANN was trained and was able to obtain a pretty low value for MSE. However, the calculated output from this ANN does not differ much from the (n-1)th bid value. It looks like ANN just takes the last bid as the next bid! I tried different network structures (all multilayer perceptions), different training parameters, etc, but results are same.</p>\n\n<p>Question 3: How can I improve the accuracy? Are there any other training methods than backpropagation?</p>\n",

If a feature occurs less than say 10 times, it's likely that it's not adding any predictive value, and it may lead to overfitting due to low frequency</li>\n<li>Try a Linear SVM instead. They handle large dimensional data very well in terms of not overfitting. They also often have the option to assign relative weights to different classes, which may help address your unbalanced problem above. The sklearn svm (which simply wraps some other packages such as libsvm) has this option.</li>\n<li>Don't use the ID column. Producing a model per user will most probably lead to overfitting. Instead, feed in attributes that describe the user that allows the model to generalize over similar users. You could try fitting a separate model per user, but you need a lot of data per user to do this well.</li>\n<li>It sounds like you really need to try some feature selection here, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. But try 1 and 2 first, as they may give you good results sooner (although the end solution may still work better with some good feature selection).

You can adapt this strategy and instead of creating a wordcloud, you can create a frequency matrix of terms used.  The idea is to take the unstructured text and structure it somehow.  You change everything to lowercase (or uppercase), remove stop words, and find frequent terms for each job function, via Document Term Matrices.  You also have the option of stemming the words.  If you stem words you will be able to detect different forms of words as the same word.  For example, 'programed' and 'programming' could be stemmed to 'program'.  You can possibly add the occurrence of these frequent terms as a weighted feature in your ML model training.</p>\n\n<p>You can also adapt this to frequent phrases, finding common groups of 2-3 words for each job function.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<p>1) Load libraries and build the example data</p>\n\n<pre><code>library(tm)\nlibrary(SnowballC)\n\ndoc1 = \"I am highly skilled in Java Programming.  I have spent 5 years developing bug-tracking systems and creating data managing system applications in C.\"\njob1 = \"Software Engineer\"\ndoc2 = \"Tested new software releases for major program enhancements.  Designed and executed test procedures and worked with relational databases.  I helped organize and lead meetings and work independently and in a group setting.\"\njob2 = \"Quality Assurance\"\ndoc3 = \"Developed large and complex web applications for client service center. Lead projects for upcoming releases and interact with consumers.  Perform database design and debugging of current releases.\"\njob3 = \"Software Engineer\"\njobInfo = data.frame(\"text\" = c(doc1,doc2,doc3),\n                     \"job\" = c(job1,job2,job3))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2) Now we do some text structuring. I am positive there are quicker/shorter ways to do the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code># Convert to lowercase\njobInfo$text = sapply(jobInfo$text,tolower)\n\n# Remove Punctuation\njobInfo$text = sapply(jobInfo$text,function(x) gsub(\"[[:punct:]]\",\" \",x))\n\n# Remove extra white space\njobInfo$text = sapply(jobInfo$text,function(x) gsub(\"[ ]+\",\" \",x))\n\n# Remove stop words\njobInfo$text = sapply(jobInfo$text, function(x){\n  paste(setdiff(strsplit(x,\" \")[[1]],stopwords()),collapse=\" \")\n})\n\n# Stem words (Also try without stemming?)\njobInfo$text = sapply(jobInfo$text, function(x)  {\n  paste(setdiff(wordStem(strsplit(x,\" \")[[1]]),\"\"),collapse=\" \")\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3) Make a corpus source and document term matrix.</p>\n\n<pre><code># Create Corpus Source\njobCorpus = Corpus(VectorSource(jobInfo$text))\n\n# Create Document Term Matrix\njobDTM = DocumentTermMatrix(jobCorpus)\n\n# Create Term Frequency Matrix\njobFreq = as.matrix(jobDTM)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we have the frequency matrix, jobFreq, that is a (3 by x) matrix, 3 entries and X number of words.</p>\n\n<p>Where you go from here is up to you.  You can keep only specific (more common) words and use them as features in your model.  Another way is to keep it simple and have a percentage of words used in each job description, say \"java\" would have 80% occurrence in 'software engineer' and only 50% occurrence in 'quality assurance'.</p>\n\n<p>Now it's time to go look up why 'assurance' has 1 'r' and 'occurrence' has 2 'r's.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>This is a tricky problem. There are many ways to handle it. I guess, resumes can be treated as semi-structured documents. Sometimes, it's beneficial to have some minimal structure in the documents. I believe, in resumes you would see some tabular data. You might want to treat these as attribute value pairs. For example, you would get a list of terms for the attribute \"Skill set\".</p>\n\n<p>The key idea is to manually configure a list of key phrases such as \"skill\", \"education\", \"publication\" etc. The next step is to extract terms which pertain to these key phrases either by exploiting the structure in some way (such as tables) or by utilizing the proximity of terms around these key phrases, e.g. the fact that the word \"Java\" is in close proximity to the term \"skill\" might indicate that the person is skilled in Java.</p>\n\n<p>After you extract these information, the next step could be to build up a feature vector for each of these key phrases. You can then represent a document as a vector with different fields (one each for a key phrase). For example, consider the following two resumes represented with two fields, namely <em>project</em> and <em>education</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Doc1: {project: (java, 3) (c, 4)}, {education: (computer, 2), (physics, 1)}</p>\n\n<p>Doc2: {project: (java, 3) (python, 2)}, {education: (maths, 3), (computer, 2)}</p>\n\n<p>In the above example, I show a term with the frequency. Of course, while extracting the terms you need to stem and remove stop-words. It is clear from the examples that the person whose resume is Doc1 is more skilled in C than that of D2. Implementation wise, it's very easy to represent documents as field vectors in Lucene.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the next step is to retrieve a ranked list of resumes given a job specification. In fact, that's fairly straight forward if you represent queries (job specs) as field vectors as well. You just need to retrieve a ranked list of candidates (resumes) using Lucene from a collection of indexed resumes.</p>\n",

Basically, any model that is predictive will yield a survival probability that is significantly lower than the baseline.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There's another approach which involves attempting to identify precursor events patterns or user behavior pattern that foreshadow defection. Any given event/behavior pattern might occur for users that defect, or for users that stay. For this analysis, you may need to censor your data to only include users that have been members for some minimum period of time. The minimum time period can be estimated using your estimate of survival function, or even simple histogram analysis of the distribution of membership period for users who have defected. </p>\n",

It's also been used to win a number of the SemEval competitions for measuring semantic similarity between documents, often in combinations with a wordnet based measure, so I wouldn't say it's going out of fashion, or is definitely inferior to LDA, which is better for topic modelling and not semantic similarity in my experience, contrary to what some responders have stated. </p>\n\n<p>If you use gensim (a python library), it has LSA, LDA and word2vec, so you can easily compare the 3. doc2vec is a cool idea, but does not scale very well and you will likely have to implement it yourself as I am unaware of any open source implementations. It does not scale well as for each document, a new and separate model has to be built using SGD, a slow machine learning algorithm. But it will probably give you the most accurate results. LSA and LDA also don't scale well (word2vec does however), LDA scales worse in general. Gensim's implementations are very fast however, as it uses iterative SVD.</p>\n\n<p>One other note, if you use word2vec, you will still have to determine a way to compose vectors from documents, as it gives you a different vector per word. The simplest way to do this is to normalize each vector and take the mean over all word vectors in the document, or take a weighted mean by idf weighting of each word. So it's not as simple as 'use word2vec', you will need to do something further to compute document similarity. </p>\n\n<p>I would personally go with LSA, as I have seen it work well empirically, and gensim's library scales very well.

The limit on training samples is because the core algorithm revolves around optimising results generated from a square matrix with dimensions based on number of training samples, not number of original features.</p>\n\n<p>So does the comment I saw refer some real change since the course was made, and if so, what is that change: A new algorithm that covers SVM's \"sweet spot\" just as well, better CPUs meaning SVM's computational advantages are not worth as much? Or is it perhaps opinion or personal experience of the commenter?</p>\n\n<p>I tried a search for e.g. \"are support vector machines out of fashion\" and found nothing to imply they were being dropped in favour of anything else.</p>\n\n<p>And Wikipedia has this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Issues\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Issues</a> . . . the main sticking point appears to be difficulty of interpreting the model.

                "_Body": "<p>SVM is a powerful classifier. It has some nice advantages (which I guess were responsible for its popularity)... These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency: Only the support vectors play a role in determining the classification boundary. All other points from the training set needn't be stored in memory.</li>\n<li>The so-called power of kernels: With appropriate kernels you can transform feature space into a higher dimension so that it becomes linearly separable. The notion of kernels work with arbitrary objects on which you can define some notion of similarity with the help of inner products... and hence SVMs can classify arbitrary objects such as trees, graphs etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are some significant disadvantages as well.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Parameter sensitivity: The performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the regularization parameter C, which allows some variance in the model.</li>\n<li>Extra parameter for the Gaussian kernel: The radius of the Gaussian kernel can have a significant impact on classifier accuracy. Typically a grid search has to be conducted to find optimal parameters. LibSVM has a support for grid search.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SVMs generally belong to the class of \"Sparse Kernel Machines\". The sparse vectors in the case of SVM are the support vectors which are chosen from the maximum margin criterion. Other sparse vector machines such as the <strong>Relevance Vector Machine</strong> (RVM) perform better than SVM. The following figure shows a comparative performance of the two. In the figure, the x-axis shows one dimensional data from two classes y={0,1}. The mixture model is defined as P(x|y=0)=Unif(0,1) and P(x|y=1)=Unif(.5,1.5) (Unif denotes uniform distribution). 1000 points were sampled from this mixture and an SVM and an RVM were used to estimate the posterior. The problem of SVM is that the predicted values are far off from the true log odds.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zNYbt.png\" alt=\"RVM vs. SVM\"> </p>\n\n<p>A very effective classifier, which is very popular nowadays, is the <strong>Random Forest</strong>. The main advantages are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only one parameter to tune (i.e. the number of trees in the forest)</li>\n<li>Not utterly parameter sensitive</li>\n<li>Can easily be extended to multiple classes</li>\n<li>Is based on probabilistic principles (maximizing mutual information gain with the help of decision trees)</li>\n</ul>\n",

I'm going to make some assumptions, the biggest is that you want to estimate a constant slope, given by some segments in your data.  Another assumption to separate the blocks of linear data is that the natural 'reset' will be found by comparing consecutive differences and finding ones that are X-standard deviations below the mean. (I chose 4 sd's, but this can be changed)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a plot of the data, and the code to generating it is at the bottom.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2dC1w.png\" alt=\"Sample Data\"></p>\n\n<p>For starters, we find the breaks and fit each set of y-values and record the slopes.</p>\n\n<pre><code># Find the differences between adjacent points\ndiffs = y_data[-1] - y_data[-length(y_data)]\n# Find the break points (here I use 4 s.d.'s)\nbreak_points = c(0,which(diffs &lt; (mean(diffs) - 4*sd(diffs))),length(y_data))\n# Create the lists of y-values\ny_lists = sapply(1:(length(break_points)-1),function(x){\n  y_data[(break_points[x]+1):(break_points[x+1])]\n})\n# Create the lists of x-values\nx_lists = lapply(y_lists,function(x) 1:length(x))\n#Find all the slopes for the lists of points\nslopes = unlist(lapply(1:length(y_lists), function(x) lm(y_lists[[x]] ~ x_lists[[x]])$coefficients[2]))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are the slopes:\n(3.309110, 4.419178, 3.292029, 4.531126, 3.675178, 4.294389)</p>\n\n<p>And we can just take the mean to find the expected slope (3.920168).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit: Predicting when series reaches 120</strong></p>\n\n<p>I realized I didn't finish predicted when series reaches 120.

The algorithm was able to <em>strip-off</em> some sets from the <code>2^n - 1</code> sets (powerset) by using a lattice to maintain the data. A drawback of the approach was the need to re-read the database to compute the frequency of each set expanded.</p>\n\n<p>Later, on year 1997, <a href=\"http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tk/2000/03/k0372-abs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaki et al.</a> proposed the algorithm <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_Eclat_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclat</a>, which <em>inserted</em> the resulting frequency of each set inside the lattice. This was done by adding, at each node of the lattice, the set of transaction-ids that had the items from root to the referred node. The main contribution is that one does not have to re-read the entire dataset to know the frequency of each set, but the memory required to keep such data structure built may exceed the size of the dataset itself.</p>\n\n<p>In 2000, <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=335191.335372\" rel=\"nofollow\">Han et al.</a> proposed an algorithm named <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_FP-Growth_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">FPGrowth</a>, along with a prefix-tree data structure named FPTree. The algorithm was able to provide significant data compression, while also granting that only frequent itemsets would be yielded (without candidate itemset generation). This was done mainly by sorting the items of each transaction in decreasing order, so that the most frequent items are the ones with the least repetitions in the tree data structure. Since the frequency only descends while traversing the tree in-depth, the algorithm is able to <em>strip-off</em> non-frequent itemsets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><strike>As far as I know, this may be considered a state-of-the-art algorithm, but I'd like to know about other proposed solutions.

Both files are under SVN control, and both machines have access to the same SVN server.</p>\n\n<p>I am sorry I do not have any advice specific to your grid system, but let me list some general points I have found important for any deployment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep production changes limited to configuration changes</strong>. You write that you have to \"use the datasets' path on the server\"; this sounds to me like you have the paths hardcoded into your Python script.  This is not a good idea, precisely because you will need to change those paths in every other machine where you move the script to.  If you commit those changes back to SVN, then on your local machine you will have the remote paths, and on and on ...  (What if there are not only paths, but also passwords?  You should not have production passwords in an SVN server.)</p>\n\n<p>So, keep paths and other setup informations in a <code>.ini</code> file and use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ConfigParser</a> to read it, or use a <code>.json</code> file and use the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">json</a> module. Keep one copy of the file locally and one remotely, both under the same path, both without SVN control, and just keep the path to that configuration file in the Python script (or get it from the command line if you can't keep both configurations under the same path).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep configuration as small as possible</strong>. Any configuration is a \"moving part\" of your application, and any system is more robust the less it has moving parts.  A good indicator of something that belongs into configuration is exactly that you have to edit it every time you move the code; things that have not needed editing can remain as constants in the code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Automate your deployment</strong>.  You can do it via a Bash script on your local machine; note that you can <a href=\"http://malcontentcomics.com/systemsboy/2006/07/send-remote-commands-via-ssh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">run any command on a remote machine</a> through <code>ssh</code>.  For instance:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>svn export yourprojectpath /tmp/exportedproject\ntar czf /tmp/yourproject.tgz /tmp/exportedproject\nscp /tmp/myproject.tgz youruser@remotemachine:~/dev\n\n## Remote commands are in the right hand side, between ''\nssh youruser@remotemachine 'tar xzf ~/dev/yourproject.tgz'\nssh youruser@remotemachine 'qsub ~/dev/yourproject/script.py'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For this to work, you need of course to have a <a href=\"http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">passwordless login</a>, based on public/private keys, set up between your local and the remote machine.</p>\n\n<p>If you need more than this, you can think of using Python's <a href=\"http://www.fabfile.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a> or the higher-level <a href=\"https://github.com/sebastien/cuisine\" rel=\"nofollow\">cuisine</a>.</p>\n",

Here's an interesting article on scientific workflows with an example of the <strong>real</strong> workflow design and data analysis, based on using <em>Kepler</em> and <em>myExperiment</em> projects: <a href=\"http://f1000research.com/articles/3-110/v1\">http://f1000research.com/articles/3-110/v1</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are many RR tools that implement <em>literate programming</em> paradigm, exemplified by <code>LaTeX</code> software family. Tools that help in report generation and presentation is also a large category, where <code>Sweave</code> and <code>knitr</code> are probably the most well-known ones. <code>Sweave</code> is a tool, focused on R, but it can be integrated with Python-based projects, albeit with some additional effort (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161152/sweave-for-python\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161152/sweave-for-python</a>). I think that <code>knitr</code> might be a better option, as it's modern, has extensive support by popular tools (such as <code>RStudio</code>) and is language-neutral (<a href=\"http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines\">http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines</a>).</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Protocol and suggested directory structure</strong>. If I understood correctly what you implied by using term <em>protocol</em> (<em>workflow</em>), generally I think that standard RR data analysis workflow consists of the following sequential phases: <em>data collection</em> => <em>data preparation</em> (cleaning, transformation, merging, sampling) => <em>data analysis</em> => <em>presentation of results</em> (generating reports and/or presentations). Nevertheless, every workflow is project-specific and, thus, some specific tasks might require adding additional steps.</p>\n\n<p>For sample directory structure, you may take a look at documentation for R package <code>ProjectTemplate</code> (<a href=\"http://projecttemplate.net\">http://projecttemplate.net</a>), as an attempt to automate data analysis workflows and projects:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0B2vo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>4) <strong>Automated build/run tools</strong>. Since my answer is focused on universal (language-neutral) RR tools, the most popular tools is <code>make</code>. Read the following article for some reasons to use <code>make</code> as the preferred RR workflow automation tool: <a href=\"http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make\">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make</a>. Certainly, there are other <strong>similar</strong> tools, which either improve some aspects of <code>make</code>, or add some additional features. For example: <code>ant</code> (officially, Apache Ant: <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org\">http://ant.apache.org</a>), <code>Maven</code> (\"next generation <code>ant</code>\": <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org\">http://maven.apache.org</a>), <code>rake</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ruby/rake\">https://github.com/ruby/rake</a>), <code>Makepp</code> (<a href=\"http://makepp.sourceforge.net\">http://makepp.sourceforge.net</a>). For a comprehensive list of such tools, see Wikipedia: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software</a>.</p>\n",

It is perfectly fine to run t-SNE ten times, and select the solution with the lowest KL divergence [2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I tried two implementations of t-SNE:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>python</strong>: sklearn.manifold.TSNE().</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong>: tsne, from library(tsne).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both these implementations, when verbosity is set, print the error (Kullback-Leibler divergence) for each iteration.

And in general, all the other good things that software engineering has created along decades for ensuring isolation and reproductibility. </p>\n\n<p>I would like to stress that it is not enough to have <em>just</em> reproducible workflows, but also <em>easy</em> to reproduce workflows. Let me show what I mean. Suppose that your project uses Python, a database X and Scipy. Most surely you will be using a specific library to connect to your database from Python, and Scipy will be in turn using some sparse algebraic routines. This is by all means a very simple setup, but not entirely simple to setup, pun intended. If somebody wants to execute your scripts, she will have to install all the dependencies. Or worse, she might have incompatible versions of it already installed. Fixing those things takes time. It will also take time to you if you at some moment need to move your computations to a cluster, to a different cluster, or to some cloud servers. </p>\n\n<p>Here is where I find docker useful. Docker is a way to formalize and compile recipes for binary environments. You can write the following in a dockerfile (I'm using here plain English instead of the Dockerfile syntax):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start with a basic binary environment, like Ubuntu's</li>\n<li>Install libsparse-dev</li>\n<li>(Pip) Install numpy and scipy</li>\n<li>Install X</li>\n<li>Install libX-dev</li>\n<li>(Pip) Install python-X</li>\n<li>Install IPython-Notebook</li>\n<li>Copy my python scripts/notebooks to my binary environment, these datafiles, and these configurations to do other miscellaneous things. To ensure reproductibility, copy them from a named url instead of a local file. </li>\n<li>Maybe run IPython-Notebook.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of the lines will be installing things in Python using pip, since pip can do a very clean work in selecting specific package versions. Check it out too!</p>\n\n<p>And that's it. If after you create your Dockerfile it can be built, then it can be built anywhere, by anybody (provided they also have access to your project-specific files, e.g. because you put them in a public url referenced from the Dockerfile). What is best, you can upload the resulting environment (called an \"image\") to a public or private server (called a \"register\") for other people to use. So, when you publish your workflow, you have both a fully reproducible recipe in the form of a Dockerfile, and an easy way for you or other people to reproduce what you do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>docker run dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if they want to poke around in your scripts and so forth:</p>\n\n<pre><code>docker run -i -t dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme /bin/bash\n</code></pre>\n",

You need to know which tool is good for what purpose.</p>\n\n<p>If dealing with large Volume of data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pig/Hive/Shark - Data cleaning and ETL work</li>\n<li>Hadoop/Spark - Distributed parallel computing</li>\n<li>Mahout/ML-Lib - Machine Learning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, you can use R/Python in intermediate stages but you'll realize that they become bottleneck in your entire process.</p>\n\n<p>If dealing with Velocity of data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kafka/Storm - High throughput system</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People are trying to R/Python here but again it depends on kind of parallelism you want and your model complexity.</p>\n\n<h3>What sort of analysis you wish to do?</h3>\n\n<p>If your model demands the entire data to be first brought into memory then your model should not be complex because if the intermediate data is large then the code will break.

If your data set is 90% ham, you can get a pretty damn good accuracy by just saying that every single email is ham, which is obviously something that indicates a non-ideal classifier. Let's start with a couple of metrics that are a little more useful for us, specifically the true positive rate (<code>TPR</code>) and the false positive rate (<code>FPR</code>):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hNxTl.png\" alt=\"ROC axes\"></p>\n\n<p>Now in this graph, <code>TPR</code> is specifically the ratio of true positive to all positives, and <code>FPR</code> is the ratio of false positives to all negatives. (Keep in mind, this is only for binary classification.) On a graph like this, it should be pretty straightforward to figure out that a prediction of all 0's or all 1's will result in the points of <code>(0,0)</code> and <code>(1,1)</code> respectively. If you draw a line through these lines you get something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1WT1.png\" alt=\"Kind of like a triangle\"></p>\n\n<p>Which looks basically like a diagonal line (it is), and by some easy geometry, you can see that the <code>AUC</code> of such a model would be <code>0.5</code> (height and base are both 1). Similarly, if you predict a random assortment of 0's and 1's, let's say 90% 1's, you could get the point <code>(0.9, 0.9)</code>, which again falls along that diagonal line.</p>\n\n<p>Now comes the interesting part. What if we weren't only predicting 0's and 1's? What if instead we wanted to say that, theoretically we were going to set a cutoff, above which every result was a 1, and below which every result were a 0. This would mean that at the extremes you get the original situation where you have all 0's and all 1's (at a cutoff of 0 and 1 respectively), but also a series of intermediate states that fall within the <code>1x1</code> graph that contains your <code>ROC</code>. In practice you get something like this:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/13McM.png\" alt=\"Courtesy of Wikipedia\"></p>\n\n<p>So basically, what you're actually getting when you do an <code>AUC</code> over accuracy is something that will strongly discourage people going for models that are representative, but not discriminative, as this will only actually select for models that achieve false positive and true positive rates that are significantly above random chance, which is not guaranteed for accuracy.</p>\n",

For basic analytics and reporting statistics will certainly help, but for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence then you'll want a few more skills</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Probability theory</strong> - you must have a solid background in pure probability so that you can decompose any problem, whether seen before or not, into probabilistic principles.  Statistics helps a lot for already solved problems, but new and unsolved problems require a deep understanding of probability so that you can design appropriate techniques.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Information Theory</strong> - this (relative to statistics) is quite a new field (though still decades old), the most important work was by Shannon, but even more important and often neglected note in literature is work by Hobson that proved that Kullback-Leibler Divergence is the only mathematical definition that truly captures the notion of a <em>\"measure of information\"</em>. Now fundamental to artificial intellgence is being able to quantify information.  Suggest reading \"Concepts in Statistical Mechanics\" - Arthur Hobson (very expensive book, only available in academic libraries).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Complexity Theory</strong> - A big problem many Data Scientists face that do not have a solid complexity theory background is that their algorithms do not scale, or just take an extremely long time to run on large data.  Take PCA for example, many peoples favourite answer to the interview question \"how do you reduce the number of features in our dataset\", but even if you tell the candidate \"the data set is really really really large\" they still propose various forms of PCA that are O(n^3).  If you want to stand out, you want to be able to solve each problem on it's own, NOT throw some text book solution at it designed a long time ago before Big Data was such a hip thing.  For that you need to understand how long things take to run, not only theoretically, but practically - so how to use a cluster of computers to distribute an algorithm, or which data structures take up less memory.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Communication Skills</strong> - A huge part of Data Science is understanding business.  Whether it's inventing a product driven by data science, or giving business insight driven by data science, being able to communicate well with both the Project and Product Managers, the tech teams, and your fellow data scientists is very important.  You can have an amazing idea, say an awesome AI solution, but if you cannot effectively (a) communicate WHY that will make the business money, (b) convince your collegues it will work and (c) explain to tech people how you need their help to build it, then it wont get done.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

Your residuals are clearly not serially uncorrelated. I rather suspect you've not told the function that your \"seasonality\" is a 24-hour cycle rather than an annual one. But hey you haven't given us any code or data so we don't really have a clue what you've done, do we? What do you think \"seasonality\" even means here? Do you have any idea?</p>\n\n<p>Your data seems the have three peaks every 24 hours. Really? Is this 'gas'='gasoline'='petrol' or gas in some heating/electric generating system? Either way if you know a priori there's an 8 hour cycle, or an 8 hour cycle on top of a 24 hour cycle on top of what looks like a very high frequency one or two hour cycle you <strong>put that in your model</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Actually you don't even say what your x-axis is so maybe its days and then I'd fit a daily cycle, a weekly cycle, and then an annual cycle. But given how it all changes at time=85 or so I'd not expect a model to do well on both sides of that.</p>\n\n<p>With statistics (which is what this is, sorry to disappoint you but you're not a data scientist yet) you don't just robotically go \"And.. Now.. I.. Fit.. An... S TL model....\". You look at your data, try and get some understanding, then propose a model, fit it, test it, and use the parameters it make inferences about the data. Fitting cyclic seasonal patterns is part of that.</p>\n",

It can also be taken care of by adding covariates to the model that tests the effect of the design decision.  It should be noted that there is still some discussion about the proper way to do this within the statistics community.  Essentially A/B testing is an application of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial\" rel=\"nofollow\">Randomized Control Trial</a> to website design.  Some people disagree with adding covariates to the test.  Others, such as Frank Harrel (see <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0387952322\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regression Modeling Strategies</a>) argue for the use of covariates in such models.</p>\n\n<p>I would offer the following suggestions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Design the study in advance so as to take care of as much sources of bias and variation as possible.   </li>\n<li>Let the data speak for itself.

There's one subtlety, though - job titles are too short to carry important context. Let me explain this. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine LinkedIn profiles (which is pretty good source for data). Normally, they contain 4-10 sentences describing person's skills and qualifications. It's pretty likely that you find phrases like \"lead data scientist\" and \"professional knowledge of Matlab and R\" in a same profile, but it's very unlikely to also see \"junior Java developer\" in it. So we may say that \"lead\" and \"professional\" (as well as \"data scientist\" and \"Matlab\" and \"R\") often occur in same contexts, but they are rarely found together with \"junior\" and \"Java\". </p>\n\n<p>Co-occurrence matrix shows exactly this. The more 2 words occur in same context, the more similar their vectors in the matrix will look like. And cosine distance is just a good way to measure this similarity. </p>\n\n<p>But what about job titles? Normally they are much shorter and don't actually create enough context to catch similarities. Luckily, you don't need source data to be titles themselves - you need to find similarities between skills in general, not specifically in titles. So you can simply build co-occurrence matrix from (long) profiles and then use it to measure similarity of titles. </p>\n\n<p><em>*</em> - in fact, it's already worked for me on a similar project. </p>\n",

This gave me a count of active actions for each second. The issue I found with this technique was that it made it difficult to adjust the time slice that I was looking at. Looking at a time slice of a minute was difficult to compute and looking at time slices of less than a second was impossible.</p>\n\n<p>I'm open to any advice on how to think about this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n",

Normally one merely selects the rank (number of features) without regard to what the features represent, and the algorithm does the rest. Like PCA, the result is not immediately interpretable but it yields good results. What you want to do is extend the movie matrix to include the additional features you mentioned and make sure that they stay fixed as the algorithm estimates the two matrices using regularizastion. The corresponding entries in the user matrix will be initialized randomly, then estimated by the matrix factorization algorithm. It's a versatile and performant approach but it takes some understanding of machine learning, or linear algebra at least.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a nice ipython notebook a while back but I can't find it right now, so I'll refer you to <a href=\"http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/diktat/CPSC540machinelearning/blob/master/1.4%20Collaborative%20Filtering%20for%20Movie%20Recommendation.ipynb\" rel=\"nofollow\">another one</a> which, while not as nice, still clarifies some of the maths.</p>\n",

Lambda is completely self-containing, so it's easy to copy its binary representation to other nodes without any worries. </p>\n\n<p>Now let's make things a bit more interesting: </p>\n\n<pre><code>f = open(\"/etc/hosts\")\nrdd = sc.parallelize(range(100))\nrdd = rdd.map(lambda x: f.read())\nrdd.collect()\nf.close()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Boom!

Obviously, file object is a handle to <em>local</em> data and thus cannot be sent to other machines. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So what's happening in your specific code?

When you call <code>sc.parallelize(...).map(vectorizer)</code> just after its definition, <code>vocab_dict</code> is available <em>locally</em>, but <em>remote</em> workers know absolutely nothing about it. Thus function is called with fewer parameters than it expects which results in <code>__init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)</code> error. </p>\n\n<p>Also note, that you follow very bad pattern of  <code>sc.parallelize(...)...collect()</code> calls. First you spread your collection to entire cluster, do some computations, and then pull the result. But sending data back and forth is pretty pointless here. Instead, you can just do these computations locally, and run Spark's parallel processes only when you work with really big datasets (like you main <code>amazon_dataset</code>, I guess).</p>\n",

When I queried the contractors, one had misunderstood the briefing and selected only ice-cream lovers from his database.</p>\n\n<p>The second error was more challenging: When doing some geographic analysis, I found that a lot of people had extremely large movement patterns, which suggested that a lot of them traveled from Munich to Hamburg in minutes. When I spoke with ppeople upstream, they found a subtle bug in their data aggregation software, which was unnoticed before.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not assume that your data was collected by perfect processes /humans.</li>\n<li>Do try to understand the limits of your data providers.</li>\n<li>Look at individual patterns / values and try to determine if they are logical (easy for movement / geographic data)</li>\n</ul>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Let's first split it into parts. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Science</strong> is about making knowledge from raw data. It uses machine learning, statistics and other fields to simplify (or even automate) decision making. Data science techniques may work with any data size, but more data means better predictions and thus more precise decisions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Hadoop</strong> is a common name for a set of tools intended to work with large amounts of data. Two most important components in Hadoop are HDFS and MapReduce.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HDFS</strong>, or Hadoop Distributed File System, is a special distributed storage capable of holding really large data amounts. Large files on HDFS are split into blocks, and for each block HDFS API exposes its <em>location</em>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>MapReduce</strong> is framework for running computations on nodes with data. MapReduce heavily uses <em>data locality</em> exposed by HDFS: when possible, data is not transferred between nodes, but instead code is copied to the nodes with data. </p>\n\n<p>So basically any problem (including data science tasks) that doesn't break data locality principle may be efficiently implemented using MapReduce (and a number of other problems may be solved not that efficiently, but still simply enough).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let's take some examples. Very often analyst only needs some simple statistics over his tabular data. In this case <a href=\"https://hive.apache.org/\"><strong>Hive</strong></a>, which is basically SQL engine over MapReduce, works pretty well (there are also Impala, Shark and others, but they don't use Hadoop's MapReduce, so more on them later). </p>\n\n<p>In other cases analyst (or developer) may want to work with previously unstructured data. Pure MapReduce is pretty good for <strong>transforming</strong> and <strong>standardizing</strong> data.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are used to exploratory statistics and visualization using tools like R. It's possible to apply this approach to big data amounts using <a href=\"https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki\"><strong>RHadoop</strong></a> package. </p>\n\n<p>And when it comes to MapReduce-based machine learning <a href=\"https://mahout.apache.org/\"><strong>Apache Mahout</strong></a> is the first to mention. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There's, however, one type of algorithms that work pretty slowly on Hadoop even in presence of data locality, namely, iterative algorithms. Iterative algorithms tend to have multiple Map and Reduce stages. Hadoop's MR framework <strong>reads</strong> and <strong>writes</strong> data to disk on each stage (and sometimes in between), which makes iterative (as well as any multi-stage) tasks terribly slow. </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are alternative frameworks that can both - use data locality and keep data in memory between stages. Probably, the most notable of them is <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\"><strong>Apache Spark</strong></a>. Spark is complete replacement for Hadoop's MapReduce that uses its own runtime and exposes pretty rich API for manipulating your distributed dataset. Spark has several sub-projects, closely related to data science: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://shark.cs.berkeley.edu/\"><strong>Shark</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/sql/\"><strong>Spark SQL</strong></a>  provide alternative SQL-like interfaces to data stored on HDFS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/streaming/\"><strong>Spark Streaming</strong></a> makes it easy to work with continuous data streams (e.g. Twitter feed)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/mllib/\"><strong>MLlib</strong></a> implements a number of machine learning algorithms with a pretty simple and flexible API</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/graphx/\"><strong>GraphX</strong></a> enables large-scale graph processing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there's pretty large set of data science problems that you can solve with Hadoop and related projects. </p>\n",

The use-case I've got is a \"recommendation engine\" for movies a user has watched. Movies have lots of string data (title, plot, tags), and I could imagine \"downsampling\" the text down to a few key words that describe that movie, but even if I parse out the top five words that describe this movie, I think I'd need input neurons for every english word in order to compare a set of movies? I could limit the input neurons just to the words used in the set, but then could it grow/learn by adding new movies (user watches a new movie, with new words)? Most of the libraries I've seen don't allow adding new neurons after the system has been trained?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a standard way to map string/word/character data to inputs into a neural network? Or is a neural network really not the right tool for the job of parsing string data like this (what's a better tool for pattern-matching in string data)?</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Using a neural network for prediction on natural language data can be a tricky task, but there are tried and true methods for making it possible.  </p>\n\n<p>In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, text is often represented using the bag of words model.  In other words, you have a vector of length n, where n is the number of words in your vocabulary, and each word corresponds to an element in the vector.  In order to convert text to numeric data, you simply count the number of occurrences of each word and place that value at the index of the vector that corresponds to the word. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model.\">Wikipedia does an excellent job of describing this conversion process.</a>  Because the length of the vector is fixed, its difficult to deal with new words that don't map to an index, but there are ways to help mitigate this problem (lookup <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing\">feature hashing</a>).  </p>\n\n<p>This method of representation has many disadvantages -- it does not preserve the relationship between adjacent words, and results in very sparse vectors.  Looking at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\">n-grams</a> helps to fix the problem of preserving word relationships, but for now let's focus on the second problem: sparsity.  </p>\n\n<p>It's difficult to deal directly with these sparse vectors (many linear algebra libraries do a poor job of handling sparse inputs), so often the next step is dimensionality reduction. For that we can refer to the field of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model\">topic modeling</a>:  Techniques like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation\">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> (LDA) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis\">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA) allow the compression of these sparse vectors into dense vectors by representing a document as a combination of topics.  You can fix the number of topics used, and in doing so fix the size of the output vector producted by LDA or LSA. This dimensionality reduction process drastically reduces the size of the input vector while attempting to lose a minimal amount of information.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, after all of these conversions, you can feed the outputs of the topic modeling process into the inputs of your neural network.     </p>\n",

I hope it may help you to solve your problem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm planning to run some experiments with very large data sets, and I'd like to distribute the computation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/meeting-justice-of-data-science\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of my posts</a>, I have done research on topic of <em>evaluation methods of Data Science</em>. With <strong>Learning Curve</strong>, you can evaluate your experiments <em>learning ability</em>. To talk a bit more, you will <strong>fix</strong> commodity configuration, and then will run same experiment on the same number of machines with different size of data set you have (from starting from small chunk in size, incrementally increase the size until you reach the whole data set). </p>\n\n<p>To point on, you should avoid having <em>power distribution</em> for result of performance test being run with different size of data sets. To avoid, you should carefully choose <em>step size</em> (step size = amount of increments).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have about ten machines available, each with 200 GB of free space on hard disk. However, I would like to perform experiments on a greater number of nodes, to measure scalability more precisely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For this type question, I have intuitively searched and read materials; afterwards, published as a <a href=\"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/scale-your-vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>. At the end of the post, I have briefly talked about how to test your hypothesis on real complex system. If you let me, I want to briefly talk about;</p>\n\n<p>First of all, <strong>base requirement</strong> should be formed in order to run data set as a whole. The minimum requirement will build your <strong>baseline evaluation score</strong> which is calculated with one/combination of evaluation metrics you have chosen, or with one/combination of methods being used to calculate <code>Running Time = Computation complexity + Communication cost + Synchronization cost</code>. </p>\n\n<p>After those steps, with an <em>evaluation strategy</em>, add new elements, e.g. new node, to the system you have doing scalability test; meanwhile, for each addition, measure performance w.r.t new system configuration. </p>\n\n<p>Just to note, <em>evaluation strategy</em> must be planned along with considerations of default behavior of parallel and distributed systems. For example, what I mean by behavior is that adding just more cores will, after some point, automatically drop performance of the system not due to your algorithm characteristics. It is because more cores need more RAMs, more hard driver, or etc. In other words, there is a <strong>N-Way</strong> relationship between hardware components. As a second example, adding more nodes to the distributed system will punished you with more communication and synchronization costs.</p>\n\n<p>As a last step, you will sketch two different graphs with your evaluation results via data analysis program or language (As a recommendation, use GNU Plot or R programming language). Print out and put those results at your desktop, and start to examine them, carefully. According to your investigation, modify/erase + rebuild <em>evaluation strategy</em> and re-do the performance test.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are there commodity services which would grant me that only my application would be running at a given time? Has anyone used such services yet?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no much experiment on commodity services, but I can easily say whether it grants or not depends on your configuration of services. If you configured say Hadoop to your node as an only service, Hadoop will grant your code will be only running at any time.</p>\n",

Different models, such as random forests, regression, etc. could capture only part of relations and ignore others. In such circumstances it makes sense to use general <strong>statistical exploration</strong> and <strong>modelling</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the very first thing I would do is finding out <strong>correlations</strong> between possible precursor conditions and diagnoses. E.g. in what percent of cases chronic kidney disease was preceded by long flu? If it is high, it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation\" rel=\"nofollow\">doesn't always mean causality</a>, but gives pretty good food for thought and helps to better understand relations between different conditions. </p>\n\n<p>Another important step is data visualisation. Does CKD happens in males more often than in females? What about their place of residence? What is distribution of CKD cases by age? It's hard to grasp large dataset as a set of numbers, plotting them out makes it much easier. </p>\n\n<p>When you have an idea of what's going on, perform <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>hypothesis testing</strong></a> to check your assumption. If you reject null hypothesis (basic assumption) in favour of alternative one, congratulations, you've made \"something real\". </p>\n\n<p>Finally, when you have a good understanding of your data, try to create complete <strong>model</strong>. It may be something general like <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm\" rel=\"nofollow\">PGM</a> (e.g. manually-crafted Bayesian network), or something more specific like linear regression or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine\" rel=\"nofollow\">SVM</a>, or anything.

After importing, your DATE column is of either <code>character</code>, or <code>factor</code> class (depending on your settings for <code>stringsAsFactors</code>). Therefore, I think that you can solve this issue in at least several ways, as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Convert data</strong> to correct type <strong>during import</strong>. To do this, just use the following options of <code>read.csv()</code>: <code>stringsAsFactors</code> (or <code>as.is</code>) and <code>colClasses</code>. By default, you can specify conversion to <code>Date</code> or <code>POSIXct</code> classes. If you need a non-standard format, you have two options. First, if you have a single Date column, you can use <code>as.Date.character()</code> to pass the desired format to <code>colClasses</code>. Second, if you have multiple Date columns, you can write a function for that and pass it to <code>colClasses</code> via <code>setAs()</code>. Both options are discussed here: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13022299/specify-date-format-for-colclasses-argument-in-read-table-read-csv\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13022299/specify-date-format-for-colclasses-argument-in-read-table-read-csv</a>.</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Convert data</strong> to correct format <strong>after import</strong>. Thus, after calling <code>read.csv()</code>, you would have to execute the following code: <code>dateColumn &lt;- as.Date(dateColumn, \"%m/%d/%Y\")</code> or <code>dateColumn &lt;- strptime(dateColumn, \"%m/%d/%Y\")</code> (adjust the format to whatever Date format you need).</p>\n",

In expectation, at least, the distribution of features in your sample must match the distribution of features in the population. When you are fitting a model with a response variable, <em>this includes features that you do not observe, but that affect any response variables in your model</em>. Since it is, in many cases, impossible to know what you do not observe, <strong>random sampling</strong> is used.</p>\n\n<p>The idea with randomization is that a random sample, up to sampling error, <em>must</em> accurately reflect the distribution of all features in the population, observed and otherwise. This is why <strong>randomization is the \"gold standard,\"</strong> but if sample control is available by some other technique, or it is defensible to argue that there are no omitted features, then it isn't always necessary.</p></li>\n<li><p>Your sample must be <strong>large enough</strong> that the effect of <strong>sampling error</strong> on the feature distribution is relatively small. This is, again, to ensure representativeness. But deciding who to sample is different from deciding how many people to sample.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since it sounds like you're fitting a model, there's the additional consideration that certain important combinations of features could be relatively rare in the population. This is not an issue for generalizability, but it bears heavily on your considerations for sample size. For instance, I'm working on a project now with (non-big) data that was originally collected to understand the experiences of minorities in college. As such, it was critically important to ensure that <strong>statistical power</strong> was high <em>specifically in the minority subpopulation</em>. For this reason, blacks and Latinos were deliberately <strong>oversampled</strong>. However, the proportion by which they were oversampled was also recorded. These are used to compute survey weights. These can be used to  re-weight the sample so as to reflect the estimated population proportions, in the event that a representative sample is required.</p>\n\n<p>An additional consideration arises if your model is hierarchical. A canonical use for a hierarchical model is one of children's behavior in schools. Children are \"grouped\" by school and share school-level traits. Therefore a representative sample of schools is required, and within each school a representative sample of children is required. This leads to <strong>stratified sampling</strong>. This and some other sampling designs are reviewed in surprising depth on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n",

You can run such a regression using R without any special efforts for sparse data. Just use the <code>lm()</code> command (for \"linear model\"). Use <code>?lm</code> to see the help page. And note that <code>lm</code> will by default silently add a constant column of ones to your design matrix (the intercept) - include a <code>-1</code> on the right hand side of your formula to suppress this. Overall, assuming all your data (and nothing else) is in a <code>data.frame</code> called <code>foo</code>, you can do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>model &lt;- lm(y~.-1,data=foo)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then you can look at parameter estimates etc. like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>summary(model)\nresiduals(model)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>If</em> your system is <em>much</em> larger, say on the order of 10,000 observations and hundreds of predictors, looking at specialized sparse solvers as per <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853\">Aleksandr's answer</a> may start to make sense.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in your comment to <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853\">Aleksandr's answer</a>, you mention constraints on your equation. If that is actually your key issue, there are ways to calculate constrained least squares in R. I personally like <code>pcls()</code> in the <code>mgcv</code> package.

The first is an upper limit on performance. It's pretty unlikely that you'll do better on data that you haven't seen than on your training data. The other thing it tells you is whether or not getting more data might help. If you can demonstrate that you fully understand your training data by driving training error to zero it might be possible, through the inclusion of more data, to drive your test error further down by getting a more complete sample and then training a powerful model on that. </p>\n",

In Java an exception can have several causing exceptions, and the whole must be analyzed.</p>\n\n<p>For example, given the following example exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>com.myapp.CustomException: Error printing ...\n... (stack)\nCaused by: com.foo.webservice.RemoteException: Unable to communicate ...\n... (stack)\nCaused by: com.acme.PrintException: PrintServer002: Timeout ....\n... (stack)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First of all, our algorithm splits the whole stack in three isolated exceptions. Afterwards it starts analyzing these exceptions starting from the most inner one. In this case, it determines that this exception (the second caused by) is of type <code>Availability</code> and that the responsible component is a \"print server\". This is because there is a rule that matches containing the word <code>Timeout</code> associated to the <code>Availability</code> type. There is also a rule that matches <code>com.acme.PrintException</code> and determines that the responsible component is a print server. As all the information needed is determined using only the most inner exception, the upper exceptions are ignored, but this is not always the case.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see this kind of approximation is very complex (and chaotic) as a human have to create new rules as new exceptions appear. Besides, the new rules have to be compatible with the current ones because a new rule for classifying a new exception must not change the classification of any of the already classified exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>We are thinking about using Machine Learning to automate this process. Obviously, I am not asking for a solution here as I know the complexity but I'd really appreciate some advice to achieve our goal.</p>\n",

That just seems wrong :)</p>\n\n<p>Is there a canonical test to use for A/B tests with small #'s of clicks?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interpretation and R code</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've used the following R code to test significance for each position:</p>\n\n<p>Position 1:</p>\n\n<pre><code>binom.test(7, 767, p=(26/753))\n\nExact binomial test\n\ndata:  7 and 767\nnumber of successes = 7, number of trials = 767, p-value = 1.077e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.03452855\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.003676962 0.018713125\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n           0.009126467\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I interpret this result to mean: The probability of success in the test group is indeed different than the control group with a 95% confidence interval that the success probability is between .368% and 1.87%</p>\n\n<pre><code>ppois(((26-1)/753), lambda=(7/767), lower.tail = F)\n[1] 0.009084947\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I interpret this result to mean: Given a Poisson distribution with a click rate of 7 per 767 trials, there is a 0.9% chance of having a click rate of 26 or more per 753 trials in the same distribution. Contextualized in the ad example,\nthere is a .1% chance that the control ad actually performs the same as the test ad.</p>\n\n<p>Is the above interpretation correct? Does the test and interpretation change with the different positions (i.e. are the results of the Poisson test more appropriate for Position 3 given the small numbers)?</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>First of all, some basics of classification (and in general any supervised ML tasks), just to make sure we have same set of concepts in mind. </p>\n\n<p>Any supervised ML algorithm consists of at least 2 components: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Dataset to train and test on.</li>\n<li>Algorithm(s) to handle these data.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Training dataset consists of a set of pairs <code>(x, y)</code>, where <code>x</code> is a <strong>vector of features</strong> and <code>y</code> is <strong>predicted variable</strong>. Predicted variable is just what you want to know, i.e. in your case it is exception type. Features are more tricky. You cannot just throw raw text into an algorithm, you need to extract meaningful parts of it and organize them as feature vectors first. You've already mentioned a couple of useful features - exception class name (e.g. <code>com.acme.PrintException</code>) and contained words (\"Timeout\"). All you need is to translate your row exceptions (and human-categorized exception types) into suitable dataset, e.g.: </p>\n\n<pre><code>ex_class                  contains_timeout  ...   | ex_type\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n[com.acme.PrintException, 1                , ...] | Availability\n[java.lang.Exception    , 0                , ...] | Network\n ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This representation is already much better for ML algorithms. But which one to take? </p>\n\n<p>Taking into account nature of the task and your current approach natural choice is to use <strong>decision trees</strong>. This class of algorithms will compute optimal decision criteria for all your exception types and print out resulting tree. This is especially useful, because you will have possibility to manually inspect how decision is made and see how much it corresponds to your manually-crafted rules. </p>\n\n<p>There's, however, possibility that some exceptions with exactly the same features will belong to different exception types. In this case probabilistic approach may work well. Despite its name, <strong>Naive Bayes</strong> classifier works pretty well in most cases. There's one issue with NB and our dataset representation, though: dataset contains <em>categorical</em> variables, and Naive Bayes can work with <em>numerical</em> attributes only*. Standard way to overcome this problem is to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_%28statistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">dummy variables</a>. In short, dummy variables are binary variables that simply indicate whether specific category presents or not. For example, single variable <code>ex_class</code> with values <code>{com.acme.PrintException, java.lang.Exception, ...}</code>, etc. may be split into several variables <code>ex_class_printexception</code>, <code>ex_class_exception</code>, etc. with values <code>{0, 1}</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ex_class_printexception  ex_class_exception  contains_timeout | ex_type\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n[1,                    , 0                 , 1              ] | Availability\n[0,                    , 1                 , 0              ] | Network\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One last algorithm to try is <strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</strong>. It neither provides helpful visualisation, nor is probabilistic, but often gives superior results. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>*</em> - in fact, neither Bayes theorem, nor Naive Bayes itself state anything about variable type, but most software packages that come to mind rely on numerical features. </p>\n",

These kinds of tests are generally used when we <em>know</em> what the inherent probability is that we're comparing to (e.g. to see if the set of coin flips has a probability significantly different from 1/2 which is what we expect from a fair coin). In this case, we don't <em>know</em> what the probability is that we're comparing to, we're just making the very crude guess that the 26/753 outcome of row 1 reflects the true probability.

MongoDB is neither fast with this type of data, nor provide any advanced tools for analysis (correct me if you know any). So I can think of a very few applications for Mongo in data mining. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Hadoop</strong> is a large ecosystem, containing dozens of different tools. I will assume that you mean core Hadoop features - HDFS and MapReduce. HDFS provides flexible way to store large amounts of data, while MapReduce gives basis for processing them. It has its clear advantages for processing multi-terabyte datasets, but it also has significant drawbacks. In particular, because of intensive disk IO during MapReduce tasks (that slows down computations a lot) it is terrible for interactive development, iterative algorithms and working with not-that-big datasets. For more details see my <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/863/1279\">earlier answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many algorithms in Hadoop require multiple MapReduce jobs with complicated data flow. This is where <strong>Scalding</strong> gets shiny. Scalding (and underlying Java's <a href=\"http://www.cascading.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cascading</a>) provides much simpler API, but at the moment uses same MapReduce as its runtime and thus holds all the same issues.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Spark</strong> addresses exactly these issues. It drops Hadoop's MapReduce and offers completely new computational framework based on distributed in-memory collections and delayed evaluations. Its API is somewhat similar to Scalding's with all MR complexity removed, so it's really easy to get started with it. Spark is also the first in this list that comes with data mining library - <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MLlib</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But Spark doesn't reinvent things like basic linear algebra. For this purpose it uses <strong>Breeze</strong>. To my opinion, Breeze is far in quality from scientific packages like SciPy, Octave or Julia, but it is still good enough for most practical use cases. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Mahout</strong> relies on Hadoop's MapReduce and thus is terrible for iterative algorithms. <strong>Spire</strong> and <strong>Saddle</strong> look cute and probably have their niche, but seem to be much less well-known than Breeze. I couldn't find much information about <strong>H2O</strong>, so it doesn't look like a big player here (comments from people who used it are welcome).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some quick summary. Spark seems to be the most simple, flexible and fast-growing project for large-scale data processing. It facilitates a number of new projects (e.g. Shark or Spark SQL) and penetrates into existing (including <a href=\"http://www.concurrentinc.com/2014/05/cascading-now-supports-tez-spark-and-storm-up-next/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cascading</a> and <a href=\"https://mahout.apache.org/users/sparkbindings/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mahout</a>). Spark knows how to utilize HDFS API, and thus scales to terabytes of data easily. And for data mining downshifters who don't want to bother with a cluster setup there's always pure Breeze. </p>\n",

Confirmatory factor analysis was implemented as a maximum likelihood estimation technique, and I could see very easily how the computation time grew with each dimension (sample size <code>n</code>, number of variables <code>p</code>, number of factors <code>k</code>). As it is heavily dependent on how Stata thinks about the data (optimized to compute across columns/observations rather than rows), I found performance to be <code>O(n^{0.68} (k+p)^{2.4})</code> where 2.4 is the fastest matrix inversion asymptotics (and there's hell of a lot of that in confirmatory factor analysis iterative maximization).

However, for reasons of numerical accuracy, no one would really brute-force inverse the <code>X'X</code> matrix, and would rather use sweep operators and identify the dangerously collinear variables to deal with precision issues. If you add up $10^8$ numbers that originally were in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format\" rel=\"nofollow\">double precision</a>, you will likely end up with a number that only has a single precision.

A big problem are unseen words/n-grams. </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to improve the classifier by adding other features, e.g. a fixed sized vector computed using distributional similarities (as computed by word2vec) or other categorical features of the examples. My idea was to just add the features to the sparse input features from the bag of words. However, this results in worse performance on the test and training set. The additional features by themselves give about 80% F-1 on the test set, so they aren't garbage. Scaling the features didn't help as well. My current thinking is that these kind of features don't mix well with the (sparse) bag of words features.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is: assuming the additional features provide additional information, what is the best way to incorporate them? Could training separate classifiers and combining them in some kind of ensemble work (this would probably have the drawback that no interaction between the features of the different classifiers could be captured)?

The storage of the distances is a burden on memory, so they're recomputed on the fly. Thankfully, only the points nearest the decision boundary are needed most of the time. Frequently computed distances are stored in a cache. If the cache is getting thrashed then the running time blows up to O(n_features x n_observations^3).

                "_Body": "<p>I will try to answer your questions, but before I'd like to note that using term \"large dataset\" is misleading, as \"large\" is a <em>relative</em> concept. You have to provide more details. If you're dealing with <strong>bid data</strong>, then this fact will most likely affect selection of preferred <em>tools</em>, <em>approaches</em> and <em>algorithms</em> for your <strong>data analysis</strong>. I hope that the following thoughts of mine on data analysis address your sub-questions. Please note that the numbering of my points does not match the numbering of your sub-questions. However, I believe that it better reflects general <strong>data analysis workflow</strong>, at least, how I understand it.</p>\n\n<p>1) Firstly, I think that you need to have at least some kind of <strong>conceptual model</strong> in mind (or, better, on paper). This model should guide you in your <em>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</em>. A presence of a <em>dependent variable (DV)</em> in the model means that in your <em>machine learning (ML)</em> phase later in the analysis you will deal with so called supervised ML, as opposed to unsupervised ML in the absence of an identified DV.</p>\n\n<p>2) Secondly, <strong>EDA</strong> is a crucial part. IMHO, EDA should include <strong>multiple iterations</strong> of producing <em>descriptive statistics</em> and <em>data visualization</em>, as you refine your understanding about the data. Not only this phase will give you valuable insights about your datasets, but it will feed your next important phase - <strong>data cleaning and transformation</strong>. Just throwing your raw data into a statistical software package won't give much - for any <strong>valid</strong> statistical analysis, data should be <em>clean, correct and consistent</em>. This is often the most time- and effort-consuming, but absolutely necessary part. For more details on this topic, read these nice papers: <a href=\"http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf</a> (by Hadley Wickham) and <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf</a> (by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo).</p>\n\n<p>3) Now, as you're hopefully done with <em>EDA</em> as well as data cleaning and transformation, your ready to start some more statistically-involved phases. One of such phases is <em>exploratory factor analysis (EFA)</em>, which will allow you to extract the underlying <strong>structure</strong> of your data. For datasets with large number of variables, the positive side effect of EFA is <em>dimensionality reduction</em>. And, while in that sense EFA is similar to <em>principal components analysis (PCA)</em> and other dimensionality reduction approaches, I think that EFA is more important as it allows to refine your conceptual model of the phenomena that your data \"describe\", thus making sense of your datasets. Of course, in addition to EFA, you can/should perform <strong>regression analysis</strong> as well as apply <strong>machine learning techniques</strong>, based on your findings in previous phases.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a note on <strong>software tools</strong>. In my opinion, current state of statistical software packages is at such point that practically any major software packages have comparable offerings feature-wise. If you study or work in an organization that have certain policies and preferences in term of software tools, then you are <em>constrained</em> by them. However, if that is not the case, I would heartily recommend <strong>open source</strong> statistical software, based on your comfort with its specific <em>programming language</em>, <em>learning curve</em> and your <em>career perspectives</em>. My current platform of choice is <strong>R Project</strong>, which offers mature, powerful, flexible, extensive and open statistical software, along with amazing ecosystem of packages, experts and enthusiasts. Other nice choices include <em>Python</em>, <em>Julia</em> and specific open source software for processing <strong>big data</strong>, such as <em>Hadoop</em>, <em>Spark</em>, <em>NoSQL</em> databases, <em>WEKA</em>. For more examples of open source software for <strong>data mining</strong>, which include general and specific statistical and ML software, see this section of a Wikipedia page: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Free_open-source_data_mining_software_and_applications\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Free_open-source_data_mining_software_and_applications</a>.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Forgot to mention <em>Rattle</em> (<a href=\"http://rattle.togaware.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rattle.togaware.com</a>), which is also a very popular open source R-oriented GUI software for data mining.</p>\n",

On that note, why haven't people used heuristic algorithms to optimize over complicated AB testing sample spaces?

Basically you need to estimate the respective class means and class covariances.  Now the first thing you care about is your estimate of the difference in the class means: but your performance is limited by the accuracy of the worst estimated mean: its no good estimating one mean to the 100th decimal place - if the other mean is only estimated to 1 decimal place.  So its a waste of computing resources to use all the data - you can instead undersample the  more common class AND reweight the classes appropriately. ( those computing resources can then be used exploring different input variables etc)</p>\n\n<p>Now the second issue is predictive accuracy: different algorithms use different error metrics, which may or may not agree with your own objectives. eg logistic regression will penalise overall probability error,  so if  most of your data is from one class, then it will tend to try to improve accurate probability estimates ( eg 90 vs 95% probability) of that one class rather than trying to identify the rare class. in that case you would definitely want to try to reweight to emphasize the rare class ( and subsequently adjust the estimate [by adjusting the bias term] to get the probability estimates realigned)</p>\n",

There are numerical issues with multiplying many small numbers(imagine if you had millions of samples you had to multiply millions of small numbers for the lhd). Also taking gradients for optimization methods that require gradients is often easier when you are dealing with the log likelihood. In general, it is good to have an objective which is a sum rather than a product of variables when dealing with optimization problems.</p>\n\n<p>Second, fmin is using Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm which has no convergence guarantees according to <a href=\"http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin.html#scipy.optimize.fmin\" rel=\"nofollow\">scipy documentation</a>. This means the convergence is totally random and you should not expect to find parameters close to the originals. To get around this, I would suggest you to use a gradient based method like stochastic gradient descent or BFGS. Since you know the generative model (rvs are Gaussian distributed) you can write the likelihood and log likelihood as:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfsvr.png\" alt=\"equations\"></p>\n\n<p>Where a,b,c and d are your model parameters 5,2,3 and 4 respectively.\nThen take the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\" rel=\"nofollow\">gradient</a> with respect to [a,b,c,d] and feed that into prime input of fmin_bfgs. Note that due to varying variance what could be solved by just linear regression is now a nastier problem.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you may also want to check Generalized least squares on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity</a>, which talk about your problem and offer several available solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n",

I would have thought it would be fairly straightforward to find documents where national origin was known, so that you could build a supervized algorithm for detecting language variant. You wouldn't even need a corpus that talked about football, since dialectical differences show up in other ways that are subject matter independent.

If the results of an unsupervized learning algorithm are fed to a supervized learning algorithm, the net result is unsupervized --- there are still no grown-ups in the room. And the classification errors of the resulting process will contain error terms from both stages. You won't get the same performance as you would if you did a SVM with properly tagged training data.

It's easy to implement, and easy to reuse in very different domains. You'll find hundreds of APRIORI implementations of varying quality. And it's easy to get APRIORI wrong, actually.</p>\n\n<p>FPgrowth is much harder to implement, but also much more interesting. So from an academic point of view, everybody tries to improve FPgrowth - getting work based on APRIORI accepted will be very hard by now.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a good implementation, every algorithm has it's good and it's bad situations in my opinion. A good APRIORI implementation will <em>only</em> need to scan the database <em>k</em> times to find all frequent itemsets of length <em>k</em>. In particular if your data fits into main memory this is cheap. What can kill APRIORI is too many frequent 2-itemsets (in particular when you don't use a Trie and similar acceleration techniques etc.). It works best on large data with a low number of frequent itemsets.</p>\n\n<p>Eclat works on columns; but it needs to read each column much more often. There is some work on diffsets to reduce this work. If your data does not fit into main memory, Eclat suffers probably more than Apriori. By going depth first, it will also be able to return a first interesting result much earlier than Apriori, and you can use these results to adjust parameters; so you need less iterations to find good parameters. But by design, it cannot exploit pruning as neatly as Apriori did.</p>\n\n<p>FPGrowth compresses the data set into the tree. This works best when you have lots of duplicate records. You could probably reap of quite some gains for Apriori and Eclat too if you can presort your data and merge duplicates into weighted vectors. FPGrowth does this at an extreme level. The drawback is that the implementation is much harder; and once this tree does not fit into memory anymore it gets a mess to implement.</p>\n\n<p>As for performance results and benchmarks - don't trust them. There are so many things to implement incorrectly. Try 10 different implementations, and you get 10 very different performance results. In particular for APRIORI, I have the impression that most implementations are broken in the sense of missing some of the main contributions of APRIORI... and of those that have these parts right, the quality of optimizations varies a lot.</p>\n\n<p>There are actually even papers on how to implement these algorithms efficiently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Efficient Implementations of Apriori and Eclat.<br /> Christian Borgelt<br />Workshop of Frequent Item Set Mining Implementations (FIMI 2003, Melbourne, FL, USA).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You may also want to read these surveys on this domain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>Goethals, Bart. \"Survey on frequent pattern mining.\" Univ. of Helsinki (2003).</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>Ferenc Bodon, A Survey on Frequent Itemset Mining, Technical Report, Budapest University of Technology and Economic, 2006, </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>Frequent Item Set Mining<br />Christian Borgelt<br />Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 2(6):437-456. 2012</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Let's work it out from the ground up. Classification (also known as categorization) is an example of <strong>supervised learning</strong>. In supervised learning you have: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>model</strong> - something that approximates internal structure in your data, enabling you to reason about it and make useful predictions (e.g. predict class of an object); normally model has parameters that you want to \"learn\"</li>\n<li><strong>training</strong> and <strong>testing datasets</strong> - sets of objects that you use for training your model (finding good values for parameters) and further evaluating </li>\n<li><strong>training</strong> and <strong>classification algorithms</strong> - first describes how to learn model from training dataset, second shows how to derive class of a new object given trained model</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now let's take a simple case of spam classification. Your training dataset is a corpus of emails + corresponding labels - \"spam\" or \"not spam\". Testing dataset has the same structure, but made from some independent emails (normally one just splits his dataset and makes, say, 9/10 of it to be used for training and 1/10 - for testing). One way to model emails is to represent each of them as a set (bag) of words. If we assume that words are independent of each other, we can use <strong>Naive Bayes classifier</strong>, that is, calculate prior probabilities for each word and each class (training algorithm) and then apply Bayes theorem to find posterior probability of a new document to belong to particular class. </p>\n\n<p>So, basically we have: </p>\n\n<pre><code>raw model + training set + training algorithm -&gt; trained model\ntrained model + classification algorithm + new object -&gt; object label\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now note that we represented our objects (documents) as a bag of words. But is the only way? In fact, we can extract much more from raw text. For example, instead of words as is we can use their <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html\">stems or lemmas</a>, throw out noisy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words\">stop words</a>, add <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml\">POS tags</a> of words, extract <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml\">named entities</a> or even explore HTML structure of the document. In fact, more general representation of a document (and, in general, any object) is a <strong>feature vector</strong>. E.g. for text: </p>\n\n<pre><code>actor, analogue, bad, burn, ..., NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ..., in_bold, ... | label\n    0,        0,   1,    1, ...,    5,    7,   2, ...,       2, ... | not spam\n    0,        1,   0,    0, ...,    3,   12,  10, ...,       0, ... | spam\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here first row is a list of possible features and subsequent rows show how many times that feature occurs in a document. E.g. in first document there's no occurrences of word \"actor\", 1 occurrence of word \"burn\", 5 nouns, 2 adjectives and 2 pieces of text in bold. Last column corresponds to a resulting class label. </p>\n\n<p>Using feature vector you can incorporate any properties of your texts. Though finding good set of features may take some time. </p>\n\n<p>And what about model and algorithms? Are we bound to Naive Bayes. Not at all. <strong>logistic regression</strong>, <strong>SVM</strong>, <strong>decision trees</strong> - just to mention few popular classifiers. (Note, that we say \"classifier\" in most cases we mean model + corresponding algorithms for training and classification). </p>\n\n<p>As for implementation, you can divide task into 2 parts: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Features extraction - transforming raw texts into feature vectors. </li>\n<li>Object classification - building and applying model.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>First point is well worked out in many <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4115526/natural-language-processing\">NLP libraries</a>. Second is about machine learning, so, depending on your dataset, you can use either <a href=\"http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/\">Weka</a>, or <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html\">MLlib</a>. </p>\n",

The SciLab (more concise due to matrix operators) code I used is</p>\n\n<pre><code>phi = [1; 0; 1; 1];\nt = [1; 0; 0; 0];\nw= [1];\n\nw' * phi(1,:)'\n\nfor in=1:100\n    y = [];\n    R = zeros(size(phi,1));\n    R_inv = zeros(size(phi,1));\n\n    for i=1:size(phi,1)\n        y(i) = 1/(1+ exp(-(w' * phi(i,:)')));\n        R(i,i) = y(i)*(1 - y(i));\n        R_inv(i,i) = 1/R(i,i);\n    end\n\n    z = phi * w - R_inv*(y - t)\n    w = inv(phi'*R*phi)*phi'*R*z\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the values for phi (input/features) and t (output/classes), it yields a weight of  -0.6931472, which is pretty much 1/3, which seems fine to me, for there is 1/3 probability of beeing assigned to class 1, if feature 1 is present (please forgive me, if my terms do not comply with ML-language completely, for I am an software developer). If I now added an intercept feature, which would accord to</p>\n\n<pre><code>phi = [1, 1; 1, 0; 1, 1; 1, 1];\nw = [1; 1];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>my R-matrix becomes singular and the last weights value is</p>\n\n<pre><code>w  =\n  - 5.8151677  \n  1.290D+30  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which - to my reading - would mean, that the probability of belonging to class 1 would be close to 1 if feature 1 is present about 3% for the rest. There has got to be any error I made, but I do not get which one. For both implementations yield the same results I suspect that there is some point I've been missing or gotten wrong, but I do not understand which one.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>The Kappa is Cohen's Kappa score for inter-rater agreement. It's a commonly-used metric for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms and human annotaters, particularly when dealing with text/linguistics. </p>\n\n<p>What it does is compare the level of agreement between the output of the (human or algorithmic) annotater and the ground truth labels, to the level of agreement that would occur through random chance. There's a very good overview of how to calculate Kappa and use it to evaluate a classifier in this stats.stackexchange.com answer <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/82162/kappa-statistic-in-plain-english\">here</a>, and a more in-depth explanation of Kappa and how to interpret it in <a href=\"http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/courses/CS6998/Interrater_agreement.Kappa_statistic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper</a>, entitled \"Understanding Interobserver Agreement: The Kappa Statistic\" by Viera &amp; Garrett (2005).</p>\n\n<p>The benefit of using Kappa, particularly in an unbalanced data set like yours, is that with a 90-10% imbalance between the classes, you can achieve 90% accuracy by simply labeling all of the data points with the label of the more commonly occurring class. The Kappa statistic is describing how well the classifier performs above that baseline level of performance.</p>\n\n<p>Kappa ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no agreement between the raters, 1 indicating a perfect agreement, and negative numbers indicating systematic disagreement. While interpretation is somewhat arbitrary (and very task-dependent), Landis &amp; Koch (1977) defined the following interpretation system which can work as a general rule of thumb:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Kappa Agreement\n&lt; 0 Less than chance agreement\n0.01–0.20 Slight agreement\n0.21– 0.40 Fair agreement\n0.41–0.60 Moderate agreement\n0.61–0.80 Substantial agreement\n0.81–0.99 Almost perfect agreement\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which would indicate that your algorithm is performing moderately well. Accuracy SD and Kappa SD are the respective Standard Deviations of the Accuracy and Kappa scores. I hope this is helpful!</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>I have a rather large commute every day - it ranges between about an hour and about an hour and half of driving.</p>\n\n<p>I have been tracking my driving times, and want to continue to do so. I am capturing the date, my time of departure, my time of arrival, the route I took (there are two or three possible ones), weather conditions (wet/dry and clear/hazy/foggy), and whether I stopped (and if so, for what reason - fuel/toilet break/food break, and for how long) for every journey to and from work.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to create a system to analyse this data and suggest an optimal departure time (for the next journey) based on day of the week, weather conditions, and whether i need to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, I can see that Tuesday mornings are worse than other mornings, the earlier I leave the more likely I am to take a toilet break or a food break, and obviously that the journey takes longer on rainy or foggy days than on clear and dry days - but I would like the system to empirically tell me that!</p>\n\n<p>I assume this is a machine-learning and statistical analysis problem.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have absolutely no knowledge of machine-learning, or statistical methods.</p>\n\n<p>What statistical methods should I use to do this kind of analysis to the point where the data will lead to suggestions like \"tomorrow is Tuesday and it is going to rain, so you must leave home between 7.50 and 8.00, and take route XYZ, to get the optimal driving time. Oh and chances are you will need a toilet break - and I have factored that in\"? (assume that I manually enter tomorrow’s weather forecast - I’ll look into integrating with a weather service later)</p>\n\n<p>Note that this is life-hacking for me, trying to optimise the hell out of a tedious process, and it is very personal - specific to me and my habits, specific to this route, and specific to the morning/evening commute times. Google Maps with Traffic, TomTom with IQ, and Waze do very well in the more open-ended situations of ad-hoc driving-time prediction. Even Apple is happy to tell me on my iPhone notification screen how long it will take me to get home if I leave right now.</p>\n\n<p>Also note, it appears to me that traffic is not a consideration - that is to say, I do not think I need to know the actual traffic conditions - traffic is a function of day of the week and weather. For example, there are more people on the roads on Monday and Tuesday mornings, and people drive more slowly, and more people are in cars (opting to drive instead of cycle or take public transport) when it rains.</p>\n\n<p>To what extent can I let the data do all the talking? I have a somewhat ambiguous hidden agenda which may not be apparent from the data;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I should be at work at 9.30 (i.,e. 9.15 +/- 15 minutes) every day, but the occasional 10am arrival is OK</li>\n<li>I want to leave home as late as possible, and yet arrive at work as early as possible</li>\n<li>I want to leave work as early as possible, and yet have done at least 8 hours’ work</li>\n<li>it is OK for me to, say, leave half an hour early on one day but stay late on another to compensate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think I can come up with a procedural formula that can encompass all of these rules, but my gut feeling is that statistical analysis can make it a lot smarter.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the methods of analysis, the technology stack is not an issue. Java is my language of choice - I am quite familiar with programming in it, and in creating web applications.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that it is possible, are there Java libraries that can provide the requisite methods?</p>\n\n<p>What limitations are there? I want to keep capturing more and more data every day, making the data set bigger, hopefully, making the prediction more accurate.</p>\n\n<p>What other ways are there to do it? Can I push this data into, say, Wolfram Programming Cloud, or maybe something Google provides to get the desired results?</p>\n",

Absent any data, I'd assume there isn't much variance over the working week, but that's one thing the data will quickly confirm or refute. If it is varying, you can use a different model for each day. </p>\n\n<p>You have two variables; the departure times from home and work, respectively. Let's call them t_h and t_w. Let's call the commute time T_c(t), where t is the time of day. You can estimate this function from the data, so I'll assume it is given.</p>\n\n<p>You want to maximize c t_h - (1-c) t_w subject to the constraints t_h + T_c(t_h) &lt; 9.5 and t_w > t_h + T_c(t_h) + 8</p>\n\n<p>where c is a constant you can set to adjust the relative importance of leaving home early relative to leaving work early. You should be able to solve this numerical optimization problem with Mathematica, MATLAB, or something similar. I would not recommend Java; it's not meant for this. The only tricky part is estimating T_c. You know that it's a non-negative function, so you could use the standard trick of estimating it's logarithm (say, with kernels) and exponentiating.

First of all, it's worth to <strong>visualize</strong> your data. I will pretend I have following data: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KciVJ.png\" alt=\"number of words vs. age\"></p>\n\n<p>Here we see slight dependency between age and number of words in responses. We may assume that young people (approx. between 12 and 25) tend to use 1-4 words, while people of age 25-35 try to give longer answers. But how do we split these points? I would do it something like this: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/uect9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In 2D plot it looks pretty straightforward, and this is how it works most of the time in practise. However, you asked for splitting data by a single variable - age. That is, something like this: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/G10GI.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Is it a good split? I don't know. In fact, it depends on your actual needs and interpretation of the \"cut points\". That's why I asked about <em>concrete</em> task. Anyway, this interpretation is up to you. </p>\n\n<p>In practise, you will have much more text-based variables. E.g. you can use every word as a feature (don't forget to <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">stem or lemmatize</a> it first) with values from zero to a number of occurrences in the response. Visualizing high-dimensional data is not an easy task, so you need a way to discover groups of data without plotting them. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Clustering</strong></a> is a general approach for this. Though clustering algorithms may work with data of arbitrary dimensionality, we still have only 2D to plot it, so let's come back to our example. </p>\n\n<p>With algorithm like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>k-means</strong></a> you can obtain 2 groups like this: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tp4aK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Two dots - red and blue - show cluster centres, calculated by k-means. You can use coordinates of these points to split your data by any subset of axes, even if you have 10k dimensions. But again, the most important question here is: <em>what linguistic features will provide reasonable grouping of ages</em>. </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>First of all, <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong> is used when you have <strong>many covariated dimensions</strong> and want to reduce problem size by rotating data points into new orthogonal basis and taking only axes with largest variance. With 8 variables (columns) your space is already low-dimensional, reducing number of variables further is unlikely to solve technical issues with memory size, but may affect dataset quality a lot. In you concrete case it's more promising to take a look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning\"><strong>online learning</strong></a> methods. Roughly speaking, instead of working with the whole dataset, these methods take a little part of them (often referred to as \"mini-batches\") at a time and build a model incrementally. (I personally like to interpret word \"online\" as a reference to some infinitely long source of data from Internet like Twitter feed, where you just can't load the whole dataset at once). </p>\n\n<p>But what if you really wanted to apply dimensionality reduction technique like PCA to a dataset that doesn't fit into a memory? Normally dataset is represented as a data matrix <em>X</em> of size <em>n</em> x <em>m</em>, where <em>n</em> is number of observations (rows) and <em>m</em> is a number of variables (columns). Typically problem with memory comes from only one of these two numbers. </p>\n\n<h2>Too many observations (n >> m)</h2>\n\n<p>When you have <strong>too many observations</strong>, but number of variables is from small to moderate, you can <strong>build covariance matrix incrementally</strong>. Indeed, typical PCA consists of constructing covariance matrix of size <em>m</em> x <em>m</em> and applying singular value decomposition to it. With <em>m</em>=1000 variables of type float64 covariance matrix has size 1000*1000*8 ~ 8Mb, which easily fits into memory and may be used with SVD. So you need only to build covariance matrix without loading entire dataset into memory - <a href=\"http://rebcabin.github.io/blog/2013/01/22/covariance-matrices/\">pretty tractable task</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can select small representative sample from your dataset and <strong>approximate covariance matrix</strong>. This matrix will have all the same properties as normal, just a little bit less accurate. </p>\n\n<h2>Too many variables (n &lt;&lt; m)</h2>\n\n<p>On another hand, sometimes, when you have <strong>too many variables</strong>, covariance matrix itself will not fit into memory. E.g. if you work with 640x480 images, every observation has 640*480=307200 variables, which results in 703Gb covariance matrix! That's definitely not what you would like to keep in memory of your computer. Or even in memory of your cluster. So we need to reduce dimensions without building covariance matrix at all. </p>\n\n<p>My favourite method for doing it is <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/Ping/KDD06_rp.pdf\"><strong>Random Projection</strong></a>. In short, if you have dataset <em>X</em> of size <em>n</em> x <em>m</em>, you can multiply it by some sparse random matrix <em>R</em> of size <em>m</em> x <em>k</em> (with <em>k</em> &lt;&lt; <em>m</em>) and obtain new matrix <em>X'</em> of a much smaller size <em>n</em> x <em>k</em> with <em>approximately same properties</em> as original one. Why it works? Well, you should know that PCA aims to find set of orthogonal axes (principal components) and project your data onto first <em>k</em> of them. It turns out, that sparse random vectors are <em>nearly orthogonal</em> and thus may also be used as a new basis. </p>\n\n<p>And, of course, you don't have to multiply the whole dataset <em>X</em> by <em>R</em> - you can translate every observation <em>x</em> into new basis separately or in mini-batches.</p>\n\n<p>There's also somewhat similar algorithm called <strong>Random SVD</strong>. I don't have any real experience with it, but you can find example code with explanations <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/11934/3305\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As a bottom line, here's short check list for dimensionality reduction of big datasets: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you have not that many dimensions (variables), simply use online learning algorithms. </li>\n<li>If there are many observations, but moderate number of variables (covariance matrix fits into memory), construct matrix incrementally and use normal SVD. </li>\n<li>If number of variables is too high, use incremental algorithms. </li>\n</ol>\n",

Therefore weightings of the form $\\sum_i w_i e_i$ are equivalent to duplicating the data w_i times (eg for w_i integer). </p>\n\n<p>One simple case is if you have repeated data - rather than keeping all the duplicated data points, you just \"weight\" your one repeated sample by the number of instances.</p>\n\n<p>Now whilst this is easy to do in a batch setting, it is hard in vowpal wabbits online big data setting: given that you have a large data set, you do not just want to represent the data n times to deal with the weighting ( because it increases your computational load). Similarly, just multiplying the gradient vector by the weighting - which is correct in batch gradient descent - will cause big problems for stochastic/online gradient descent: essentially you shoot off in one direction ( think of large integer weights) then you shoot off in the other - causing significant instability. SGD essentially relies on all the errors to be of roughly the same order ( so that the learning rate can be set appropriately). So what they propose is to ensure that the update for training sample x_i with weight n is equivalent to presenting training sample x_i n times consecutively.</p>\n\n<p>The idea being that presenting it consecutively reduces the problem because the error gradient (for that single example $x_i$) reduces for each consecutive presentation and update (as you get closer &amp; closer to the minimum for that specific example). In other words the consecutive updates provides a kind of feedback control. </p>\n\n<p>To me it sounds like you would still have instabilities (you get to zero error on x_i, then you get to zero error on x_i+1,...). the learning rate will need to be adjusted to take into account the size of the weights.</p>\n",

If a pair of items is accessed together often, then the items are similar.</p>\n\n<p>Because this is a case of a high dimensionality (# of users and items will be in 10,000's) I think I am justified in trying to use SVD as a pre-clustering step and then do some classical clustering. When I tried doing this I got poor clustering results when compared with simple hierarchical clustering. Items that weren't very similar were being bucketed together in one dimension, while there were available dimensions that weren't used. The results weren't completely random, but they were definitely worse than the output from the hierarchical clustering. I attempted the SVD step with Mahaut and Octave and the results were similar. For the hierarchical clustering I used the Jaccard measure.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I am starting to doubt the notion of SVD as a way to reduce dimensionality. Do you think that SVD cannot be used effectively in this case (and why?) or do you think that I made some mistake along the way?</p>\n",

Since the size of the dataset is fixed, I will reuse the data T times. At each iteration or \"epoch\", I use each training sample exactly once after randomly reordering the whole training set.</p>\n\n<p>My implementation is based on Python and Numpy. Therefore, using vector operations can remarkably decrease computation time. Coming up with a vectorized implementation of batch gradient descent is quite straightforward. However, in the case of stochastic gradient descent I can not figure out how to avoid the outer loop that iterates through all the samples at each epoch.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know any vectorized implementation of stochastic gradient descent? </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I've been asked why would I like to use online gradient descent if the size of my dataset is fixed. </p>\n\n<p>From [1], one can see that online gradient descent converges slower than batch gradient descent to the minimum of the empirical cost. However, it converges faster to the minimum of the expected cost, which measures generalization performance. I'd like to test the impact of these theoretical results in my particular problem, by means of cross validation. Without a vectorized implementation, my online gradient descent code is much slower than the batch gradient descent one. That remarkably increases the time it takes to the cross validation process to be completed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I include here the pseudocode of my on-line gradient descent implementation, as requested by ffriend.

(Even calculating mean values repeatedly would be computationally expensive.) Further, how would I manage predictions based on different feature sets? Meaning, if I added a new feature, how would I know which models to train on new features? It could quickly snowball into a huge mess.</p>\n\n<p>My current solution is to track it all in a local NoSQL database (MongoDB). For example, I might have a collection <code>features</code>, each entry of which has a name, a description of how the feature was was calculated, the python file that ran the extraction, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, a collection <code>models</code> includes models run on the data. Each entry might have a name, a list of features that were used to train the model, its eventual parameters, predicted values on a held-out test set, metrics for how the model performed, etc. </p>\n\n<p>From my vantage point, this has a number of benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By saving predictions, I can use them later in ensemble predictions.</li>\n<li>Because I keep track of which features were used, I know which ones need retraining as I extract more features.</li>\n<li>By saving model descriptions, I ensure that I always know what I've tried. I never have to wonder, \"Have I tried LASSO with regularization parameters set by grid-search CV?\" I can always look it up, and see how successful it was.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From your question, it sounds like you could adapt this approach to your problem's workflow.

                "_Body": "<p>Common rule in machine learning is to <strong>try simple things first</strong>. For predicting continuous variables there's nothing more basic than <strong>simple linear regression</strong>. \"Simple\" in the name means that there's only one predictor variable used (+ intercept, of course): </p>\n\n<pre><code>y = b0 + x*b1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>b0</code> is an intercept and <code>b1</code> is a slope. For example, you may want to predict lemonade consumption in a park based on temperature:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cons = b0 + temp * b1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Temperature is in well-defined <strong>continuous</strong> variable. But if we talk about something more abstract like \"weather\", then it's harder to understand how we measure and encode it. It's ok if we say that the weather takes values <code>{terrible, bad, normal, good, excellent}</code> and assign values numbers from -2 to +2 (implying that \"excellent\" weather is twice as good as \"good\"). But what if the weather is given by words <code>{shiny, rainy, cool, ...}</code>? We can't give an order to these variables. We call such variables <strong>categorical</strong>. Since there's no natural order between different categories, we can't encode them as a single numerical variable (and linear regression expects numbers only), but we can use so-called <strong>dummy encoding</strong>:  instead of a single variable <code>weather</code> we use 3 variables - <code>[weather_shiny, weather_rainy, weather_cool]</code>, only one of which can take value 1, and others should take value 0. In fact, we will have to drop one variable because of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity\" rel=\"nofollow\">collinearity</a>. So model for predicting traffic from weather may look like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>traffic = b0 + weather_shiny * b1 + weather_rainy * b2  # weather_cool dropped\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where either <code>b1</code> or <code>b2</code> is 1, or both are 0. </p>\n\n<p>Note that you can also encounter non-linear dependency between predictor and predicted variables (you can easily check it by plotting <code>(x,y)</code> pairs). Simplest way to deal with it without refusing linear model is to use polynomial features - simply add polynomials of your feature as new features. E.g. for temperature example (for dummy variables it doesn't make sense, cause <code>1^n</code> and <code>0^n</code> are still 1 and 0 for any <code>n</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>traffic = b0 + temp * b1 + temp^2 * b2 [+ temp^3 * b3 + ...]\n</code></pre>\n",

This rules out a conventional RDBMS, and demands new techniques for processing; in particular, various Hadoop-like frameworks make it easy to distribute a computation over a cluster, at the cost of restricting the form of this computation. I'll second the reference to <a href=\"http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html</a> ; Big Data techniques are a last resort for datasets which are simply too big to handle any other way. I'd say any dataset for any purpose could qualify if it was big enough - though if the shape of the problem is such that existing \"big data\" tools aren't appropriate, then it would probably be better to come up with a new name.</p>\n\n<p>Of course there is some overlap; when I (briefly) worked at last.fm, we worked on the same 50TB dataset using Hadoop and also in an SQL database on a fairly ridiculous server (I remember it had 1TB RAM, and this is a few years ago). Which in a sense meant it both was and wasn't big data, depending on which job you were working on. But I think that's an accurate characterization; the people who worked on the Hadoop jobs found it useful to go to Big Data conferences and websites, while the people who worked on the SQL jobs didn't.</p>\n",

I have not encountered it before so here is a solution I just made up, inspired by the approach taken by the word2vec paper:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Define the pair-wise similarity based on the longest common substring (LCS), or the LCS normalized by the products of the string lengths. Cache this in a matrix for any pair of strings considered since it is expensive to calculate. Also consider approximations.</p></li>\n<li><p>Find a Euclidean (hyperspherical, perhaps?) embedding that minimizes the error (Euclidean distance if using the ball, and the dot product if using the sphere). Assume random initialization, and use a gradient-based optimization method by taking the Jacobian of the error.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now you have a Hilbert space embedding, so cluster using your algorithm of choice!</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Response to deleted comment asking how to cluster multiple substrings</em>: The bulk of the complexity lies in the first stage; the calculation of the LCS, so it depends on efficiently you do that. I've had luck with genetic algorithms. Anyway, what you'd do in this case is define a similarity <em>vector</em> rather than a scalar, whose elements are the k-longest pair-wise LCS; see <a href=\"http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8361/algorithm-find-the-first-k-longest-substrings-between-two-similar-strings\">this</a> discussion for algorithms. Then I would define the error by the sum of the errors corresponding to each substring.</p>\n\n<p>Something I did not address is how to choose the dimensionality of the embedding. The word2vec paper might provide some heuristics; see <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/word2vec-toolkit/HRvNPIqe6mM\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> discussion. I recall they used pretty big spaces, on the order of a 1000 dimensions, but they were optimizing something more complicated, so I suggest you start at R^2 and work your way up. Of course, you will want to use a higher dimensionality for the multiple LCS case.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>\"<strong>Granularity</strong>\" refers to the <strong><em>resolution</em></strong> of the variables under analysis.  If you are analyzing <em>height</em> of people, you could use <em>course-grained variables</em> that have only a few possible values -- e.g. \"above-average, average, below-average\" -- or a <em>fine-grained variable</em>, with many or an infinite number of values -- e.g. integer values or real number values.</p>\n\n<p>A measure is \"<strong>fuzzy</strong>\" if the distinction between alternative values is not crisp.  In the course-grained variable for <em>height</em>, a \"crisp\" measure would mean that any given individual could <em>only</em> be assigned one value -- e.g. a tall-ish person is either \"above-average\", or \"average\".  In contrast, a \"fuzzy\" measure allows for <em>degrees of membership</em> for each value, with \"membership\" taking values from 0 to 1.0.  Thus, a tall-ish person could be a value of \"0.5 above-average\", \"0.5 average\", \"0.0 below-average\".</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a measure is \"<strong>rough</strong>\" when two values are given: upper and lower bounds as an estimate of the \"crisp\" measure.  In our example of a tall-ish person, the rough measure would be {UPPER = above-average, LOWER = average}.</p>\n\n<p>Why use granular, fuzzy, or rough measures at all, you might ask?  Why not measure everything in nice, precise real numbers?  Because many real-world phenomena don't have a good, reliable intrinsic measure and measurement procedure that results in a real number.  If you ask married couples to rate the quality of their marriage on a scale from 1 to 10, or 1.00 to 10.00, they might give you a number (or range of numbers), but how reliable are those reports? Using a course-grained measure (e.g. \"happy\", \"neutral/mixed\", \"unhappy\"), or fuzzy measure, or rough measure can be more reliable and more credible in your analysis.  Generally, it's much better to use rough/crude measures well than to use precise/fine-grained measures poorly.</p>\n",

Sometimes, its importance relies on the fact that it allows you to carry on with what you are doing. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you usually need column independence (independent variables between predictors) because multiple regression will behave badly with highly correlated variables. Even worst, when some of your columns (or rows) are dependent, your matrix is not invertible. Why? Because matrix inversion A^-1 involves the determinant 1/|A|, which is 0 when columns or rows are linearly dependent.</p>\n\n<p>Eigenvalues is a common occurrence in calculations related to maximization/minimization in machine learning. Let's say you are interested in principal component analysis. A very important idea there is dimensional reduction (you have a dataset with many variables and want to reduce the number of variables without losing too much explanatory power.) One solution is to project your data onto a lower dimensional space (e.g. taking your data with 50 variables and reducing them to 5 variables.) Turns out a good projection to use is one that includes as much variation as possible and maximization of this variation results in the eigenvalue equation S u  = λ u. </p>\n\n<p>In other cases, you explicitly include the eigenvalue equation of some quantity of interest because in doing so, you're changing the coordinate system in which you represent the variables. Take the case of a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution in which the argument of the exponent is given by Δ = (x-μ)^T Σ (x-μ). If you consider the eigenvalue equation of Σ, the exponent can be written as Δ = y_1^2 / λ_1 + y_2^2 / λ_2 (in two dimensions) This is the equation of an ellipse only if λ_1 and λ_2 are positive. Therefore, you obtain the following graphical interpretation (Bishop, PRML, p.81):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pNrLb.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Positive semi-definite matrices are used as a matter of convenience. They are well-behaved and well-understood. For instance, their eigenvalues are non-negative, and if you remember the previous paragraph, the argument Δ required positive eigenvalues. By now, you can see why some concepts are very popular: You need them for your calculations or they need each other.</p>\n\n<p>I can recommend a couple of books:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0534998453\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction</a> by David Poole </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1584888326\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding Complex Datasets: Data Mining with Matrix Decompositions </a> by David Skillicorn. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The second recommendation is more specialized and requires a decent understanding of the basics, but it is of great help to understand matrix decompositions.</p>\n",

The first challenge is about finding the right features. If I only have text (250 words each) what method would you recommend to find the right features? My first approach is to remove all stop-words and use the POS-Tagger (<a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stanford NLP POS-Tagger</a>) to find nouns, adjective etc. I count them an use all frequently appeared words as features.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. politics, I've around 2.000 text-entities. With the mentioned POS-Tagger I found:</p>\n\n<pre><code>law:           841\ncapitalism:    412\npresident:     397\ndemocracy:     1007\nexecutive:     112\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would it be right to use only that as features? The trainings-set would then look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Training set for politics:\nfeature law         numeric\nfeature capitalism  numeric\nfeature president   numeric\nfeature democracy   numeric\nfeature executive   numeric\nclass politics,all_others\n\nsample data:\npolitics,5,7,1,9,3\npolitics,14,4,6,7,9\npolitics,9,9,9,4,2,1\npolitics,5,8,0,7,6\n...\nall_others,0,2,4,1,0\nall_others,0,0,1,1,1\nall_others,7,4,0,0,0\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would this be a right approach for binary-classification?

                "_Body": "<p>I think perhaps the first thing to decide that will help clarify some of your other questions is whether you want to perform binary classification or multi-class classification. If you're interested in classifying each instance in your dataset into more than one class, then this brings up a set of new concerns regarding setting up your data set, the experiments you want to run, and how you plan to evaluate your classifier(s). My hunch is that you could formulate your task as a binary one where you train and test one classifier for each class you want to predict, and simply set up the data matrix so that there are two classes to predict - (1) the one you're interested in classifying and (2) everything else.</p>\n\n<p>In that case, instead of your training set looking like this (where each row is a document and columns 1-3 contain features for that document, and the class column is the class to be predicted): </p>\n\n<pre><code>1           2           3           class\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    politics\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    law\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    president\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    politics\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it would look like the following in the case where you're interested in detecting the politics class against everything else:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1           2           3           class\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    politics\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    non-politics\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    non-politics\nfeature1    feature2    feature3    politics\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You would need to do this process for each class you're interested in predicting, and then train and test one classifier per class and evaluate each classifier according to your chosen metrics (usually accuracy, precision, or recall or some variation thereof).</p>\n\n<p>As far as choosing features, this requires quite a bit of thinking. Features can be highly dependent on the type of text you're trying to classify, so be sure to explore your dataset and get a sense for how people are writing in each domain. Qualitative investigation isn't enough to decide once and for all what are good features, but it is a good way to get ideas. Also, look into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\" rel=\"nofollow\">TF-IDF</a> weighting of terms instead of just using their frequency within each instance of your dataset. This will help you pick up on (a) terms that are prevalent within a document (and possibly a target class) and (b) terms that distinguish a given document from other documents. I hope this helps a little.</p>\n",

There is quite a bit of functionality right out of the box, and you can quickly import CSV data into the application, extract features, and start running experiments. It also makes use of suites of algorithms from several other prominent, well-regarded open source toolkits like Weka and LibLinear so you know you're using something credible under the hood. That being said, both of these last mentioned toolkits are definitely worth checking out for added functionality, even if they have a bit of a steeper learning curve. Hope that helps.</p>\n",

On the other hand, I can offer my own experience: my subject matter expertise (which I like better as a term than \"Substantive Expertise\", because you should really also have \"Substantive Expertise\" in math/stats and hacking) is in the retail business, my math/stats are forecasting and inferential statistics, and my hacking skills lie in R.</p>\n\n<p>From this vantage point, I can talk to and understand retailers, and someone who doesn't have at least a passing knowledge of this field will have to face a <em>steep</em> learning curve in a project with retailers. As a side gig, I do statistics in psychology, and it's exactly the same there. And even with quite some knowledge of the hacking/math/stats part of the diagram, I would have a hard time getting up to speed in, say, credit scoring or some other new subject field.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have a certain amount of math/stats and hacking skills, it is <em>much</em> better to acquire a grounding in one or more subjects than in adding <em>yet</em> another programming language to your hacking skills, or <em>yet</em> another machine learning algorithm to your math/stats portfolio. After all, once you have a solid math/stats/hacking grounding, you could if need be learn such new tools from the web or from textbooks in a relative short time period. But the subject matter expertise, on the other hand, you will likely not be able to learn from scratch if you start from zero. And clients will rather work with some data scientist A who understands their specific field than with another data scientist B who first needs to learn the basics - even if B is better in math/stats/hacking.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, all this will also mean that you will never become an expert in <em>either</em> of the three fields. But that's fine, because you are a data scientist, not a programmer or a statistician or a subject matter expert. There will always be people in the three separate circles who you can learn from.

As you write, you could bucketize your data (say into days), but as you also write, you would lose information. In addition, you may end up with missing values, so you would need to impute, since ARIMA is not very good at handling missing values.</p>\n\n<p>One alternative, as you again write, is to feed time dummies into a regression framework. I personally do not really like categorical dummies, because this implies a sharp cutoff between neighboring categories. This is usually not very natural. So I would rather look at periodic splines with different periodicities. This approach has the advantage of dealing with your uneven sampling and also with missing values.</p>\n\n<p>Be <em>very</em> careful about interpreting $R^2$. In-sample fit is notoriously misleading as a measure of out-of-sample forecast accuracy (<a href=\"https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5\" rel=\"nofollow\">see here</a>). I would argue that this disconnect between in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecast accuracy also means that there is no connection between in-sample fit and how well a model \"understood\" the data, even if your interest lies not in forecasting, but only in modeling per se. My philosophy is that if you can't forecast a time series well, you haven't understood it in any meaningful sense.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, don't overdo the modeling. Just from eyeballing your data, it is obvious that <em>something</em> happened in June, on one day in August and in September/October. I suggest you first find out what this <em>something</em> was and include this in your model, e.g., as explanatory variables (which you can include in ARIMAX if you want to). What happened there is obviously not seasonality.</p>\n",

E.g. says, said,\nsaying will all map to root form - say </li>\n<li>Stemmer: It is similar to a\nlemmatizer, but it stems a word rather than get to the root form.\ne.g. laughed, laughing will stem to laugh. However, said, saying\nwill map to sa - which is not particularly enlightening in terms of\nwhat \"sa\" means</li>\n<li>POS tagger: Tags a word with the Part of Speech - what is a noun, verb, preposition etc.</li>\n<li>Parser: Links words with POS tags to other words with POS tags. E.g. John ate an apple. Here John and apple are nouns linked by the verb - eat. John is the subject of the verb, and apple is the object of the verb.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you are looking for the state of the art for these tools, check out <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">StanfordCoreNLP</a>, which has most of these tools and a trained model to identify the above from a document.

This is because the training model used my NLTK probably does not have enough data to recognize Obama as a PERSON. So, one way would be to update this model by training a new model with a lot of labeled training data. Generating labeled training data is one of the most expensive tasks in NLP - because of all the man hours it takes to tag sentences with the correct Part of Speech as well as semantic role. </p></li>\n<li><p>In sentence 2, there are 2 concepts - \"Former Vice President\", and \"Dick Cheney\". You can use co-reference to identify the relation between the 2 NNPs. Both the NNP are refering to the same entity, and the same entity could be referenced as - \"former vice president\" as well as \"Dick Cheney\". Co-reference is often used to identify the Named entity that pronouns refer to. e.g. \"Dick Cheney is the former vice president of USA. He is a Republican\". Here the pronoun \"he\" refers to \"Dick Cheney\", and it should be identified by a co-reference identification tool. </p></li>\n</ol>\n",

However, since I am dealing with 32768 bits at different locations, it is quite hard to visualize if there is some kind of dependency. </p>\n\n<p>As every bit at location <code>x</code>can be regarded as one dimension of an observation I thought to use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, for every of the 5 devices:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I randomly sample <code>n</code> measurements at point <code>t1</code>and <code>t2</code> seperatly</li>\n<li>I prepare an array as input for <code>pca()</code> with <code>m</code>*n columns (<code>m</code>&lt; 32768; its a subset of all the observed bits, as the original data might be too big for pca) and 4 rows (one row for each device).</li>\n<li>On this array <code>A</code> I calculate the pca: ``[coeff score latent] = pca(zscore(A))```</li>\n<li>Then I try to visualize it using <code>biplot</code>: <code>biplot(coeff(:,1:2), 'score', score(:,1:2))</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, this gives me really strange results. Maybe PCA is not the right approach for this problem? I also modified the input data to do the PCA not on the logical bit array itself. Instead, I created a vector, which holds the indices where there is a '1' in the original measurement array. Also this produces strange results.</p>\n\n<p>As I am completely new to PCA I want to ask you if you either see a flaw in the process or if PCA is just not the right approach for my goal and I better look for other dimension reduction approaches or clustering algorithms.</p>\n",

Assuming one user profiles takes 10Kb of storage, you need only ~9.5Gb for every million of users, which is pretty little and gives you all advantages of mature relational databases. </p>\n\n<p>It makes sense to use <strong>HBase</strong> only when you have really many users (say, > 1B) or when data is very sparse (most columns are empty). But don't expect it to be as convenient as good old SQL databases. </p>\n\n<p>In advertising, and especially in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding\" rel=\"nofollow\">real-time bidding</a>, very fast retrieval of user profiles is needed. <a href=\"http://www.aerospike.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Aerospike</strong></a> becomes more and more popular for this task.</p>\n\n<h3>Analysing data slices</h3>\n\n<p>Common use of business logs is to analyse specific slices of data, e.g. number of users from France that visited sites from \"game\" category on November 1-14, 2014. Standard way to manage such data efficiently is to organize them into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>data cubes</strong></a>. You won't get individual records (e.g. users), but you'll get aggregated statistics really fast. </p>\n\n<p>Such cubes may have many different dimensions, but in 99% of cases they have <strong>date field</strong> that they are <strong>partitioned</strong> by. It makes great sense, because almost every query includes time period to get data from. </p>\n\n<p>As for software, <strong>Vertica</strong> is great for such aggregations. Cheaper* solution from Hadoop world is <strong>Impala</strong>, which is also great. </p>\n\n<p>(* - if you count only license price)</p>\n\n<h3>Machine learning</h3>\n\n<p>It really depends on concrete tasks and ML toolkit in use. For real-time bidding you would want blazing fast access to user profile vectors and would probably prefer Aerospike. For online learning <strong>Spark Streaming</strong> may be used as a data source, and no storage used at all. For offline machine learning there's excellent <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>MLlib</strong></a> from the same Spark project, which works with a variety of sources. </p>\n",

Big Data is often characterized by the 3 V's: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>volume, </li>\n<li>velocity, and </li>\n<li>variety. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More V's than these 3 have been invented since. I suppose the V's were a catchy way to characterize what is Big Data.</p>\n\n<p>But as hinted, computational intensity is a perfect reason for using Hadoop (if your algorithm is computationally expensive). And, as hinted, the problem you describe is perfect for Hadoop, especially since it is embarrassingly parallel in nature. </p>\n\n<p>Is Hadoop a good choice for you? I would argue, yes. Why? Because </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hadoop is open source (compared with proprietary systems which may be expensive and black boxes), </li>\n<li>your problem lends itself well to the MapReduce paradigm (embarassingly parallel, shared-nothing), </li>\n<li>Hadoop is easily scalable with commodity hardware (as opposed to specialized hardware, and you should get linear speed-up in your performance with just throwing hardware at the problem, and you can just spin a cluster as needed on cloud service providers),</li>\n<li>Hadoop allows multiple client languages (Java is only one of many supported languages),</li>\n<li>there might be a library available already to do your cross-product operation, and</li>\n<li>you're shipping compute code, not data, around the network (which you should benefit from, and as opposed to other distributed platforms where you are shipping data to compute nodes which is the bottleneck).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please note, Hadoop is not a distributed file system (as mentioned, and corrected already). Hadoop is distributed storage and processing platform. The distributed storage component of Hadoop is called the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and the distributed processing component is called MapReduce. </p>\n\n<p>Hadoop has now evolved slightly. They keep the HDFS part for distributed storage. But they have a new component called YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which serves to appropriate resources (CPU, RAM) for any compute task (including MapReduce). </p>\n\n<p>On the \"overhead\" part, there is noticeable overhead with starting/stopping a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) per tasks (map tasks, reduce tasks). You can specify for your MapReduce Jobs to reuse JVMs to mitigate this issue. </p>\n\n<p>If \"overhead\" is really an issue, look into Apache Spark, which is part of the Hadoop ecosystem, and they are orders of magnitude faster than MapReduce, especially for iterative algorithms. </p>\n\n<p>I have used Hadoop to compute pairwise comparisons (e.g. correlation matrix, similarity matrix) that are O(N^2) (n choose 2) in worst case running time complexity. Imagine computing the correlations between 16,000 variables (16,000 choose 2); Hadoop can easily process and store the results if you have the commodity resources to support the cluster. I did this using the preeminent cloud service provider (I won't name it, but you can surely guess who it is), and it cost me &lt; $100 and under 18 hours.  </p>\n",

In the future I can (and will) use some additional information about the users and tracks (f.e. duration, year, genre, band etc). At the moment I just interest to collect some methods for rating normalisation without to use additional information (users &amp; items features). My problem is, the data set doesn't have any <code>Rating</code> at the first. I create someself the column <code>Rating</code>, based on the number of events for unique <code>User-Item</code> pair (I have this information). You can of course understand that some users can hear some tracks many times, and another users only one time. Consequently the dispersion is very high and I want to reduce it (normalise the ratings value).</p>\n",

Mini-batch is a small subset of original dataset (say, 100 examples).

Oryx is a very practical tool for implementing recommendation.

User and item can be anything actually, and the same procedure can be used for tagging. For example, for recommending songs, finding similar songs and bands, and finding similar users according to their music tastes you can represent data as</p>\n\n<p>UserId SongId NumberOfPlays</p>\n\n<p>Where NumberOfPlays is the amount of times a song has been played by user (in an online music service for example). This exampl was given in Myrrix the predecessor of Oryx.

Once that is estimated, you could create additional features representing the lagged values and move forward with \"sequence mining\" as you have already suggested in the question itself. </p>\n\n<p>For each variable, Var_i, you will have to estimate its lag l_i. This lag can be calculated by estimating the order of a Markov chain with seven symbols (you could use either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion\" rel=\"nofollow\">BIC</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion\" rel=\"nofollow\">AIC</a> to estimate this order; both would require calculating likelihood of candidate orders and pick the order that maximizes either of these criteria). Once you are done calculating the order of the Markov chain for each of the variables, then you could represent your dataset such that each row will have the current value of Var_i and its preceding values, all the way back to its estimated lag l_i.

For example logistic regression returns positive/negative depending on whether the logistic function is greater/smaller than a threshold, usually 0.5 by default.

You have to choose one.</p>\n\n<p>For a given choice of threshold, you can compute accuracy, which is the proportion of true positives and negatives in the whole data set.</p>\n\n<p>AUC measures how true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate trade off, so in that sense it is already measuring something else. More importantly, AUC is not a function of threshold. It is an evaluation of the classifier as threshold varies over all possible values. It is in a sense a broader metric, testing the quality of the internal value that the classifier generates and then compares to a threshold. It is not testing the quality of a particular choice of threshold.</p>\n\n<p>AUC has a different interpretation, and that is that it's also the probability that a randomly chosen positive example is ranked above a randomly chosen negative example, according to the classifier's internal value for the examples.</p>\n\n<p>AUC is computable even if you have an algorithm that only produces a ranking on examples. AUC is not computable if you truly only have a black-box classifier, and not one with an internal threshold. These would usually dictate which of the two is even available to a problem at hand.</p>\n\n<p>AUC is, I think, a more comprehensive measure, although applicable in fewer situations. It's not strictly better than accuracy; it's different. It depends in part on whether you care more about true positives, false negatives, etc.</p>\n\n<p><em>F-measure is more like accuracy in the sense that it's a function of a classifier and its threshold setting.

If your goal is to only get training data, that's all you need:</p>\n\n<p>My answer form the cross-post:\n\"Having developed a commercial analyzer of this kind, I can tell you that there is no easy solution for this problem. But there are multiple shortcuts, especially if your domain is limited to cameras/electronics.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, you should look at more sites. Many have product brand annotated in the page (proper html annotations, bold font, all caps in the beginning of the name). Some sites have entire pages with brand selectors for search purposes. This way you can create a pretty good starter dictionary of brand names. Same with product line names and even with models. Alphanumeric models can be extracted in bulk by regular expressions and filtered pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of other tricks, but I'll try to be brief. Just a piece of advice here: there is always a trade-off between manual work and algorithms. Always keep in mind that both approaches can be mixed and both have return-on-invested-time curves, which people tend to forget. If your goal is not to create an automatic algorithm to extract product brands and models, this problem should have limited time budget in your plan. You can realistically create a dictionary of 1000 brands in a day, and for decent performance on known data source of electronic goods (we are not talking Amazon here or are we?) a dictionary of 4000 brands may be all you need for your work. So do the math before you invest weeks into the latest neural network named entity recognizer.\"</p>\n",

That in itself is not a reason for concern. </p>\n\n<p>From a slightly theoretical point of view, you can ask yourself why you should scale your features and why you should scale them in exactly the chosen way.<br>\nOne reason may be that your particular training algorithm is known to converge faster (better) with values around 0 - 1 than with features which cover other orders of magnitude. In that case, you're probably fine. My guess is that your SVM is fine: you want to avoid too large numbers because of the inner product, but a max of 1.2 vs. a max of 1.0 won't make much of a difference.<br>\n(OTOH, if you e.g. knew your algorithm to not accept negative values you'd obviously be in trouble. )</p>\n\n<p>The practical question is whether your model performs well for cases that are slightly out of the range covered by training. This I believe can best and possibly only be answered by testing with such cases / inspecting test results for performance drop for cases outside the training domain. It is a valid concern and looking into this would be part of the validation of your model. </p>\n\n<p>Observing differences of the size you describe is IMHO a reason to have a pretty close look at model stability. </p>\n",

I think there is probably some method in the text mining literature, but I haven't come across anything just right...</p>\n\n<p>What is/are some methods for tackling a problem where the number of variables it its self a variable.  This is not a missing data problem, but one where the nature of the problem fundamentally changes. Consider the following example:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I want to predict who will win a race, a simple multinomial classification problem. I have lots of past data on races, plenty to train on.  Lets further suppose I have observed each contestant run multiple races. The problem however is that the number or racers is variable. Sometimes there are only 2 racers, sometimes there are as many as 100 racers.</p>\n\n<p>One solution might be to train a separate model for each number or racers, resulting in 99 models in this case, using any method I choose.  E.g. I could have 100 random forests. </p>\n\n<p>Another solution might be to include an additional variable called 'number_of_contestants' and have input field for 100 racers and simply leave them blank when no racer is present.  Intuitively, it seems that this method would have difficulties predicting the outcome of a 100 contestant race if the number of racers follows a Poisson distribution (which I didn't originally specify in the problem, but I am saying it here).    </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n",

In the latter case you would have a learning-to-rank problem.</p>\n\n<p>If the contestant landscape can change it would help to find a vector space embedding for them so you can use the previous embeddings as an initial guess and rank anyone, even hypothetical, given their vector representation. As the number of users increases the embedding should stabilize and retraining should become less costly. The question is how to find the embedding, of course. If you have a lot of training data, you could probably find a randomized one along with the ranking function. If you don't, you would have to generate the embedding by some algorithm and estimate only the ranking function.

Here's the gist...</p>\n\n<p>First, a few definitions of data science offered by others:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Josh Wills</strong> from <strong>Cloudera</strong> says</a> a data scientist is someone \"who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nivertech/status/180109930139893761\" rel=\"nofollow\">A frequently-heard <strong>joke</strong></a> is that a \"Data Scientist\" is a Data Analyst who lives in California.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigDataBorat/status/372350993255518208\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to <strong>Big Data Borat</strong></a>, Data Science is statistics on a Mac.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Drew Conway's</strong> famous Data Science Venn Diagram</a>, it's the intersection of Hacking Skills, Math &amp; Statistics Knowledge, and Substantive Expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Here's another good definition I found on the <a href=\"http://www.itproportal.com/2014/02/11/how-to-pick-a-data-scientist-the-right-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>ITProPortal</strong> blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"A data scientist is someone who understands the domains of programming, machine learning, data mining, statistics, and hacking\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's how we define Data Science at <strong>Altamira</strong> (my current employer):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YAUZy.png\" alt=\"data science diagram\"></p>\n\n<p>The bottom four rows are the <strong>table stakes</strong> -- the cost of admission just to play the game. These are foundational skills that all aspiring data scientists must obtain. Every data scientist must be a <strong>competent programmer</strong>. He or she must also have a solid grasp of math, statistics, and <strong>analytic methodology</strong>. Data science and \"<strong>big data</strong>\" go hand-in-hand, so all data scientists need to be familiar with frameworks for distributed computing. Finally, data scientists must have a basic understanding of the domains in which they operate, as well as excellent communications skills and the ability to <strong>tell a good story with data</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>With these basics covered, the next step is to develop <strong>deep expertise</strong> in one or more of the vertical areas. \"Data Science\" is really an umbrella term for a collection of interrelated techniques and approaches taken from a variety of disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, and software engineering. The goal of these diverse methods is to <strong>extract actionable intelligence</strong> from data of all kinds, enabling clients to make better <strong>data-driven decisions</strong>. No one person can ever possibly master all aspects of data science; doing so would require multiple lifetimes of training and experience. The best data scientists are therefore \"<strong>T-shaped</strong>\" individuals -- that is, they possess a breadth of knowledge across all areas of data science, along with deep expertise in at least one. Accordingly, the best <strong>data science teams</strong> bring together a set of individuals with complementary skillsets spanning the <strong>entire spectrum</strong>.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>What would you put on a CTQ or Voice of Customer diagram for the following hypothetical scenario?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sinclair Corporation <br>\n  THE COMPANY <br>\n  Sinclair Corporation is based in Traverse City, MI and\n  acquired Premium Photo Products seven months ago.\n  Premium makes several types of film. The “Premium\n  1000” series is made with a high quality, supersensitive\n  emulsion. It is nationally marketed in roll form for\n  amateurs and sheet and film-pack forms for\n  professionals. <br>\n  Roll film is similar to most film commonly used by the\n  general public. <br>\n  Sheet film is handled in total darkness, negatives being\n  withdrawn from between interleaf papers by the\n  photographer and inserted into a light-tight holder\n  which is then placed in the camera. <br>\n  Film-pack is a self-contained unit ready to install in the\n  camera. The photographer merely pulls a paper tab to\n  shift the exposed negative out of position and a new\n  one into position. <br>\n  The procedure for using and developing all of this film\n  has not changed since introduction. “Premium 1000” is\n  produced in small lots at the Denver plant. After\n  packaging, the film is shipped to dealers across the\n  country for display and sale; a remarkably stable film\n  with a shelf life of eighteen months, “Premium 1000”\n  has an excellent reputation in the trade. <br>\n  THE SITUATION <br>\n  During the last 48 hours Sales, Manufacturing and\n  Research have been working to resolve this sudden and\n  serious problem with the “Premium 1000” film. <br>\n  Customer and dealer complaints about fogged sheet\n  film are mounting. This crisis now requires immediate\n  action before “Premium 1000” has to be removed from\n  the market entirely. <br>\n  During the past ten days, dealers in several sales\n  districts have had customer complaints of fogged sheet\n  film. In some cases, dealers have accumulated\n  complaints for several days before they reported them. <br>\n  Complaints, mounting every day, have since spread to\n  all sales districts in the country. Right now there are\n  complaints from 682 of our 7000 dealers. Although\n  Sales is replacing each box of fogged film with two new\n  boxes, this has not placated anyone. Two commercial\n  studios, for example, threaten total cancellation of\n  further use of our products because our film, which\n  they used to photograph unique events, was fogged and\n  the pictures consequently ruined. <br>\n  Sales has been very concerned by several\n  manufacturing problems which have resulted in failures\n  to meet delivery requirements. For example: a serious\n  fire two months ago in the “Premium 1000” film\n  emulsion department resulted in the discharge of\n  several employees for carelessness and the intensive\n  training of the new emulsion mixers; delivery quantity\n  difficulties on interleaf paper for over a month after the\n  acquisition; delay in arrival of the new bulk raw\n  ingredient storage containers. Though the interleaf\n  delivery difficulties cleared up by acquiring a new\n  suppler, all of the new bulk storage containers have not\n  arrived and so the old ones are still being used. <br>\n  Sales of sheet film, as well as film-pack, have quickly\n  dropped and some professionals have begun using\n  competitive brands. So far, replacing the fogged film\n  and Premium’s good reputation has kept most dealers\n  from defecting. <br>\n  Sales found that all “Premium 1000” film is shipped,\n  distributed, stocked and sold by dealers the same way.\n  They also found that all complaints so far are coming\n  from small outlets where turnover is very slow, but they\n  expect to hear complaints from the larger outlets soon. <br>\n  None of the film was outdated and the fogging was\n  seen as soon as it was developed rather than later.\n  Sales asks that we stop production for a couple of days\n  until Manufacturing thoroughly checks out their\n  operation (i.e., effects of the fire, effectiveness of\n  emulsion mixer training, and possible contamination by\n  the new storage containers). The expense involved in\n  doing this would be about \\$30,000. <br>\n  Manufacturing believes the new zip-top sheet film\n  package is responsible. Because of substantial\n  customer complaints that our package was hard to\n  open, Sales rushed the introduction of the easier to\n  open zip-top package five weeks ago. There was no Page 2 of 2\n  time for thorough testing. The problem started since\n  then. Manufacturing recommends going back to the\n  former package. It was used for three years without\n  difficulty. This will gain time to further investigate the\n  zip-top package. They urge an immediate hold on\n  expansion of the zip-top package to other “Premium\n  1000” film. This proposal would require a commitment\n  of only \\$20,000, but could invite an added source of\n  known customer dissatisfaction at this critical time.\n  Research has conducted tests on sample returns. Their\n  findings are below. <br>\n  THE LAB REPORT <br>\n  Memo from the Research Director (delivered 4 days\n  after the first reports started coming in)\n  We have studied the samples of returned fogged film\n  provided by Sales and have attempted to reproduce the\n  fogging exactly as it appears on the returns. <br>\n  We analyzed fifty returned boxes of film and found two\n  things they all had in common: all negatives in a box are\n  fogged; fogging is even across the entire surface of each\n  negative. <br>\n  We then took thirty-six samples of good sheet film from\n  the plant warehouse and carefully subjected these to a\n  variety of tests. The only way we were able to\n  reproduce exactly the unique fogging effect was to\n  expose the sheet film to a source of radiation (such as\n  an x-ray machine). <br>\n  Recognizing that this type of film is supersensitive and is\n  more susceptible to contamination, and having clearly\n  demonstrated that radiation produces the exact\n  characteristics of the returned fogged film, we believe\n  that a source of radioactivity is the root of the problem. <br>\n  We know that traces of radioactive fallout have\n  contaminated various products in the past.

The reason for this is IMHO the fact that data <em>transformation</em> and <em>cleaning</em> is very <strong>domain-</strong> and <strong>project-specific</strong>. Having said that, there are multiple tools that can help with these activities in terms of <em>partial automation</em> and <em>integration</em> with and between existing statistical and Web frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>For example, for <strong>Python</strong>, the use of <em>data manipulation</em> library <code>pandas</code> as well as <em>machine learning</em> library <code>scikit-learn</code> can be easily integrated with Web frameworks (especially Python-based, but not necessarily), as these libraries are also Python-based. These and other Python data science tools that might be of interest can be found here: <a href=\"http://pydata.org/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pydata.org/downloads</a>. Specifically, for cleaning and pre-processing tasks, which you asked about, <code>pandas</code> seem to be the first tool to explore. Again, for Python, the following discussion on StackOverflow on methods and approaches might be helpful: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/14262433/2872891\">http://stackoverflow.com/q/14262433/2872891</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Consider an example of <strong>another platform</strong>. The use of <code>pandas</code> for data transformation and cleaning is rather <em>low-level</em>. The platform that I like very much and currently use as the platform of choice for data science tasks is <code>R</code>. Rich <em>ecosystem of R packages</em> especially shines in the area of data transformation and cleaning. This is because, in addition to very flexible low-level methods of performing these tasks, there are some R packages, which take a <em>higher-level approach</em> to the problem, which may potentially improve developer's productivity and decrease the amount of defects. In particular, I'm talking about two packages, which I find very promising: <code>editrules</code> and <code>deducorrect</code>. You can find more detailed information about these and other R packages for data transformation and cleaning in my another answer here on <em>Data Science StackExchange</em> (paper that I reference in the last link there could be especially useful, as it presents an <em>approach</em> to data transformation and cleaning that is <em>generic</em> enough, so that could be used as a <strong>framework</strong> for this on any decent platform): <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/722/2452\">http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/722/2452</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: On the topic of <em>recommender systems</em> and their integration with data wrangling tools and Web frameworks, you may find my other answer here on DS SE useful: <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/836/2452\">http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/836/2452</a>.</p>\n",

It is also useful for development of small systems and rapid prototyping because it takes less lines of code than some other languages and it has an interactive mode for fast feedback. One notable Scala framework is Akka which uses the actor model of concurrent computation. Many of Odersky's presentations are on YouTube and there is a list of tools implemented with Scala on wiki.scala-lang.org.</p>\n\n<p>An implicit point is that tools and frameworks written in Scala inherently have Scala integration and usually a Scala API. Then other APIs may be added to support other languages beginning with Java since Scala is already integrated and in fact critically depends on Java.  If a tool or framework is not written in Scala, it is unlikely that it offers any support for Scala.  That is why in answer to your question I have pointed towards tools and frameworks written in Scala and Spark is one example.  However, Scala currently has a minor share of the market but its adoption rate is growing and the high growth rate of Spark will enhance that. The reason I use Scala is because Spark's API for Scala is richer than the Java and Python APIs. </p>\n\n<p>The main reasons I prefer Scala generally is because it is much more expressive than Java because it allows and facilitates the use of functions as objects and values while retaining object oriented modularity, which enables development of complex and correct programs with far less code than Java which I had preferred because of widespread use, clarity and excellent documentation.</p>\n",

Make a corupus of all the words observed as your vector of inputs.  Make a corpus off all the tags that are observed as your vector of outputs.  An NB classifier with multiple outputs is the equivalent of having multiple NB classifiers with one output each (so do whichever is easier to implement in whatever software framework you're using).  Treat each element as a training sample where a given input (a word) is a <code>1</code> if that word is present and a <code>0</code> if that word isn't.  Use the same binary scheme for the output.</p>\n\n<p>This brute forces the application of the NB Classifier to your data, and leaves you to find meaning by still haivng to mine the huge set of classifiers you'll be left with.</p>\n\n<h2>More Graceful: Process your data</h2>\n\n<p>This is the approach I'd recommend if you want to run with one multiple-class NB Classifier.  </p>\n\n<p>Your goal here is to figure out how to map each set of tags to a single class.  I'm sure there is some sort of clustering scheme or network analysis (perhaps [\"celebrity\"] linked to [\"murder\"] could become a the segment [\"debauchery\"]) that will sensibly map your tags to one single cluster.  If you treat tags as nodes and two given tags together as links, then you'll want to look into community detection algorithms (which is where I'd start).  But, if you just want something working, then some sort of hack on the tags that converts a list of tags to only the tag that's most commonly seen in your dataset would be enough.</p>\n\n<p>This method front-loads the work of cleaning your data and would make the NB Classifier's output easier to understand.</p>\n",

The 'functional' part of this is a fundamental difference in the language that makes you think differently about programming.  If you like that way of thinking, it lets you quickly work with small data.  Whether you like it or not, functional languages are fundamentally easier to massively scale.  The jvm piece is also important because the jvm is basically everywhere and, thus, Scala code can run basically everywhere.  (Note there are plenty of other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages\">languages written on the jvm</a> and plenty of other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Functional_languages\">functional programming languages</a>, and languages beyond Scala do appear in both lists.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jg1AheF4n0\">This talk</a> give a good overview of the motivation behind Scala.</p>\n\n<h2>Re: other tools that have good Scala support:</h2>\n\n<p>As you mentioned, Spark (distributable batch processing better at iteratative algorithms than its counterpart) is a big one.  With Spark comes its libraries <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/mllib/\">Mllib</a> for machine learning and <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/graphx/\">GraphX</a> for graphs.  As mentioned by  Erik Allik and Tris Nefzger, <a href=\"http://akka.io\">Akka</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/factorie/factorie\">Factorie</a> exist.  There is also <a href=\"https://www.playframework.com/\">Play</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Generally,  I can't tell if there is a specific use case you're digging for (if so, make that a part of your question), or just want a survey of big data tools and happen to know Scala a bit and want to start there.</p>\n",

This assumption is based on budgetary details from your question. However, there is one <em>exclusion</em> to this - below I will add a reference to one commercial product, which I believe might be beneficial in your case (provided that you could afford that). I also assume that <em>browser-based solutions are acceptable</em> (I would even prefer them, unless you have specific contradictory requirements).</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, the first candidate as a solution to your problem I would consider <strong>D3.js JavaScript library</strong>: <a href=\"http://d3js.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://d3js.org</a>. However, despite <em>flexibility</em> and other <em>benefits</em>, I think that this solution is <em>too low-level</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I would recommend you to take a look at the following <strong>open source projects for big data visualization</strong>, which are <em>powerful</em> and <em>flexible</em> enough, but operate at a <em>higher level of abstraction</em> (some of them are based on D3.js foundation and sometimes are referred to as D3.js <a href=\"http://schoolofdata.org/2013/08/12/climbing-the-d3-js-visualisation-stack\" rel=\"nofollow\">visualization stack</a>).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bokeh</strong> - Python-based interactive visualization library, which supports big data and streaming data: <a href=\"http://bokeh.pydata.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bokeh.pydata.org</a></li>\n<li><strong>Flot</strong> - JavaScript-based interactive visualization library, focused on jQuery: <a href=\"http://www.flotcharts.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.flotcharts.org</a></li>\n<li><strong>NodeBox</strong> - unique rapid data visualization system (not browser-based, but multi-language and multi-platform), based on generative design and visual functional programming: <a href=\"https://www.nodebox.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nodebox.net</a></li>\n<li><strong>Processing</strong> - complete software development system with its own programming language, libraries, plug-ins, etc., oriented to visual content: <a href=\"https://www.processing.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.processing.org</a> (allows executing Processing programs in a browser via <a href=\"http://processingjs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://processingjs.org</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Crossfilter</strong> - JavaScript-based interactive visualization library for big data by Square (very fast visualization of large multivariate data sets): <a href=\"http://square.github.io/crossfilter\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://square.github.io/crossfilter</a></li>\n<li><strong>bigvis</strong> - an R package for big data exploratory analysis (not a visualization library per se, but could be useful to process large data sets /aggregating, smoothing/ prior to visualization, using various R graphics options): <a href=\"https://github.com/hadley/bigvis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hadley/bigvis</a></li>\n<li><strong>prefuse</strong> - Java-based interactive visualization library: <a href=\"http://prefuse.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://prefuse.org</a></li>\n<li><strong>Lumify</strong> - big data integration, analysis and visualization platform (interesting feature: supports Semantic Web): <a href=\"http://lumify.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lumify.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Separately, I'd like to mention two open source <em>big data analysis and visualization projects</em>, focused on <strong>graph/network data</strong> (with some support for <em>streaming data</em> of that type): <a href=\"http://www.cytoscape.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cytoscape</a> and <a href=\"https://gephi.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gephi</a>.

The reason I made an exclusion for it from my open source software compilation is due to its <strong>built-in support for big data platforms</strong>. In particular, Zoomdata provides <em>data connectors</em> for Cloudera Impala, Amazon Redshift, MongoDB, Spark and Hadoop, plus search engines, major database engines and streaming data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I have no affiliation with Zoomdata whatsoever - I was just impressed by their <em>range of connectivity options</em> (which might <strong>cost</strong> you dearly, but that's another <em>aspect</em> of this topic's analysis).</p>\n",

We don't just want to memorize the the link between a given input and a given output (otherwise you wouldn't be modeling data, you'd be memorizing 1:1 connections with a dict / hash / relational database table / etc).  We want to capture the underlying pattern in the data from only looking at the training data.</p>\n\n<p>Let's expand a little on your gravity example.  You have your 10 training samples showing the start and ending position of an object dropped.  For consistency, let's say the object was dropped the moment the object's location was initially recorded and the ending location was recorded at some precise time interval later (but before the object hit the ground).  Let's also say the model (neural network in this case) managed to precisely learn the expected change in location since it just comes down to subtraction in one axis.  You can show it another 10, 100, 1000 examples that all leverage the connection found and your model will keep performing well.</p>\n\n<p>Why not keep going to 10k, 100k, or even more samples?  Theoretically, if you managed to isolate the connection and run the experiment the same way each time, your model will always work.  But realistically, something is going to eventually change in the system.  You hire a new lab assistant who tends to press the 'record location' button well after having dropped the object (giving the object more initial velocity, which you won't notice having only recorded location).  Maybe you lost your initial ball and had to use something else which is lighter and catches the wind more (so it goes slower).  .... the longer you run the experiment, the more small changes will creep into your system.  Eventually these changes will alter the connection enough to make your initial model wrong.</p>\n\n<p>When modeling data, we want to capture the underlying patterns and acknowledge that the model only matters as long as those underlying patterns stay relevant.  It's not really about the number of samples.  It's about the connections / the model itself.  The number of samples just happens to be one of the better proxies we have - the more samples you use, the more confident you have some underlying pattern.  'Statistical validity' is one stab at solving this, though it's validity is still up for question in the era of big data.  There is <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5726612&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5726612\" rel=\"nofollow\">plenty of work</a> done trying to solve for how to gain confidence in good generalization in neural networks specifically, but it's still very much an open question.</p>\n\n<p>For a different example, if you're looking at user behavior, you'll see differences between day and night; weekdays and weekends; summer and winter; year of a person's life; culture a person grew up in... even if you prove you found a pattern in your initial sample, the system will eventually change and it's up to luck whether the connection(s) you found are a part of the system that changed or a part of the system that didn't.</p>\n",

For a comprehensive resource, dedicated to <strong>data science and related degree programs</strong> (both <em>traditional</em> and <em>online</em>), please visit this page: <a href=\"http://www.kdnuggets.com/education/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kdnuggets.com/education/index.html</a>. A <strong>comprehensive</strong> review of <strong>all</strong> these offerings is IMHO an enormous task and is <strong>far</strong> beyond an answer here on Stack Exchange or, even, a lengthy blog post.</p>\n\n<p>However, nowadays one is not limited to <em>traditional educational options</em> and I think it's important to be aware of <strong>other educational options</strong>. One of the other options include <strong>certifications</strong> (linked at the above-mentioned page, but, in my opinion, the only certification worth considering is the <a href=\"https://www.informs.org/Certification-Continuing-Ed/Analytics-Certification\" rel=\"nofollow\">Certified Analytics Professional</a> as a <em>solid</em> and <em>vendor-neutral</em> certification from a reputable INFORMS). Another option is recently booming <strong>data science intensive educational offerings</strong>, from <em>short-term</em> (and often too commercial, to put it lightly) <em>bootcamps</em> to <em>more solid offerings</em>, including free, but competitive, ones, such as <a href=\"http://insightdatascience.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Insight Data Science Fellows Program</a>, where one needs to be a PhD to apply, or its sister program <a href=\"http://www.insightdataengineering.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program</a>, which doesn't have such requirement. Finally, there is yet another option: <strong>self-study</strong>. It partially intersects with the certificate option, if one uses <em>massive open online courses (MOOC)</em> (a review of which deserves a separate comprehensive post), but there are <strong>open curricula</strong> that might suit one better, such as the <em>Open Source Data Science Masters</em> curriculum, linked in my <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/742/2452\">earlier relevant answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> While your question focuses on data science, I think that it may be wise to at least consider another career path, given your <em>math background</em>. I'm talking about <strong>operations research</strong> field, which is not that far away from data science (and even somewhat intersects with it). While similar, data science is IMHO more statistics-focused, whereas operations research is more math-focused, at least that's how I see it. Despite all the popularity and \"gold rush\" of data science, operations research career is a solid one, just not as hot. Of course, if you're excited about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning and, especially, deep learning, data science career is the way to go. Whatever you will choose, the good thing is that with your math background it will be easy to change focus, should you decide to. Hope this helps. Good luck!</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<h1>Background</h1>\n\n<p>I'm working on a time series data set of energy meter readings. The length of the series varies by meter - for some I have several years, others only a few months, etc. Many display significant seasonality, and often multiple layers - within the day, week, or year.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I've been working on is clustering of these time series. My work is academic for the moment, and while I'm doing other analysis of the data as well, I have a specific goal to carry out some clustering.</p>\n\n<p>I did some initial work where I calculated various features (percentage used on weekends vs. weekday, percentage used in different time blocks, etc.). I then moved on to looking at using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to obtain the distance between different series, and clustering based on the difference values, and I've found several papers related to this.</p>\n\n<h1>Question</h1>\n\n<p>Will the seasonality in a specific series changing cause my clustering to be incorrect? And if so, how do I deal with it?</p>\n\n<p>My concern is that the distances obtained by DTW could be misleading in the cases where the pattern in a time series has changed. This could lead to incorrect clustering.</p>\n\n<p>In case the above is unclear, consider these examples:</p>\n\n<h2>Example 1</h2>\n\n<p>A meter has low readings from midnight until 8AM, the readings then increase sharply for the next hour and stay high from 9AM until 5PM, then decrease sharply over the next hour and then stay low from 6PM until midnight. The meter continues this pattern consistently every day for several months, but then changes to a pattern where readings simply stay at a consistent level throughout the day.</p>\n\n<h2>Example 2</h2>\n\n<p>A meter shows approximately the same amount of energy being consumed each month. After several years, it changes to a pattern where energy usage is higher during the summer months before returning to the usual amount.</p>\n\n<h1>Possible Directions</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've wondered whether I can continue to compare whole time series, but split them and consider them as a separate series if the pattern changes considerably. However, to do this I'd need to be able to detect such changes. Also, I just don't know if this is a suitable way or working with the data.</li>\n<li>I've also considered splitting the data and considering it as many separate time series. For instance, I could consider every day/meter combination as a separate series. However, I'd then need to do similarly if I wanted to consider the weekly/monthly/yearly patterns. I <em>think</em> this would work, but it's potentially quite onerous and I'd hate to go down this path if there's a better way that I'm missing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Further Notes</h1>\n\n<p>These are things that have come up in comments, or things I've thought of due to comments, which might be relevant. I'm putting them here so people don't have to read through everything to get relevant information.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I'm working in Python, but have rpy for those places where R is more suitable. I'm not necessarily looking for a Python answer though - if someone has a practical answer of what should be done I'm happy to figure out implementation details myself.</li>\n<li>I have a lot of working \"rough draft\" code - I've done some DTW runs, I've done a couple of different types of clustering, etc. I think I largely understand the direction I'm taking, and what I'm really looking for is related to how I process my data before finding distances, running clustering, etc. Given this, I suspect the answer would be the same whether the distances between series are calculated via DTW or a simpler Euclidean Distance (ED).</li>\n<li>I have found these papers especially informative on time series and DTW and they may be helpful if some background is needed to the topic area: <a href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/selected_publications.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/selected_publications.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>P.S. - I can't post in Meta or even a comment yet, so sorry for the off-topic bit, but: I love this site and hope it picks up steam! I was so happy when I found it, I immediately found topics which weren't covered at all or as helpfully at SO and CV. I feel a lot more comfortable asking this question here because it's not a pure statistics question or a programming question. I would feel like I was asking something potentially off-topic at either of those sites, and I feel like I'm more likely to get an answer which really covers my question and which I can understand by asking here.</p>\n",

Complexity in decision trees is manifested as adding new decision boundaries, so any limit in complexity is a limit in the decision boundaries it can draw.  Two common ways to do this is to place constraints on when a new decision can be created (a minimum of data in a leaf, significant increase in information, etc) or more simply to limit the max depth of the tree.</p>\n",

There's no problem with larger coefficients of latent vectors unless you use regularization (and, likely, you do). In case of regularization your optimal solution will tend towards smaller values, and'd sometimes prefer to sacrifice some accuracy for lower regularization penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Gradient Descent doesn't suffer from problem of large coefficients (unless you run into some sort of numerical issues): if the learning rate is tuned properly (there are lots of stuff on it, google), it should arrive to equivalent parameters.

At some point N, you'll see the performance seems to hit an upper limit and increasing nodes beyond this will stop giving significant performance gains.

I was trying to predict google searchs from the last 6 months values, or 6 values in monthly data. Daily data would imply a work on 180 past values. (I have 10 years of data so 120 points in monthly data / 500+ in weekly data/ 3500+ in daily data)</p>\n\n<p>The other approach would be to \"merge\" daily data in weekly/monthly data. But some questions arise from this process. Some data can be averaged because their sum represent something. Rainfall for example, the amount of rain in a given week will be the sum of the amounts for each days composing the weeks. </p>\n\n<p>In my case I am dealing with prices, financial rates and other things. For the prices it is common in my field to take volume exchanged into account, so the weekly data would be a weighted average. For financial rates it is a bit more complex a some formulas are involved to build weekly rates from daily rates.  For the other things i don't know the underlying properties. I think those properties are important to avoid meaningless indicators (an average of fiancial rates would be a non-sense for example). </p>\n\n<p>So three questions: </p>\n\n<p><strong>For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I feel like breaking weekly/monthly data into daily data like i've done is somewhat wrong because I am introducing quantities that have no sense in real life. So almost the same question: </p>\n\n<p><strong>For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last but not least: <strong>when given two time series with different time steps, what is better: Using the Lowest or the biggest time step ?</strong> I think this is a compromise between the number of data and the complexity of the model but I can't see any strong argument to choose between those options. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: if you know a tool (in R Python even Excel) to do it easily it would be very appreciated.</p>\n",

The comportement of the client also depends on their awareness wich depends on the evolution of rates. I've added this in model using past 6 month rates as features in polynomial regression. </p>\n\n<p>In fact media coverage of rate mostly depends on rate variations and I wanted to add that in my model.  The idea would be to add a derivative/variation of rate as a feature. But I anticipated something wrong, example with only two month , my variation will be of the form $x_n - x_{n-1}$ that is a simple linear combination of actual and past rates. So for a 1d polynomial regression i will have:</p>\n\n<p>$$ x_{n+1} = a * x_{n} +  b * x_{n-1} + c * (x_{n} - x_{n-1})$$ </p>\n\n<p>instead of: </p>\n\n<p>$$ x_{n+1} = a_0 * x_{n} +  b_0 * x_{n-1}$$</p>\n\n<p>wich is strictly equivalent with $ a + c = a_0 $ and $b-c= b_0$. Higher polynomial degree results in a more or less equivalent result. </p>\n\n<p>I am thinking about a way to include derivative information but it seems not possible. So I am wondering if all the information is included in my curve. Is this a general idea ? all information is somewhat directly contained in data and modifications of features will result in higher order objective function ?</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Let me give you a few simple approaches in time series analysis.</p>\n\n<p>The first approach consists in using previous values of your time series $Y_{t}$ as in $Y_{t} = \\phi_{1}Y_{t-1} + ... + \\phi_{n}Y_{t-n}$. In case you don't know, these models are called autoregressive (AR) models. This answers your first question. Of course it is useful to include the previous value of your time series. There is a whole set of models based on that idea.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach is taking a window and extracting some features to describe the time series at each point in time. Then you use a conventional machine learning technique to predict future values as typically done. This is more common in a classification or regression setting but future values can be thought of as classifying future values. This technique has the advantage of dramatically reducing the number of features, although you usually lose characteristics associated with time. This addresses your second concern.</p>\n\n<p>Another model that could be helpful in your case is the vector autoregressive model (VAR) (using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>'s notation):</p>\n\n<p>$$\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\ny_{1,t} \\\\\ny_{2,t} \n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}c_{1} \\\\ c_{2}\\end{array}\\right) + \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}A_{1,1} &amp; A_{1,2} \\\\ A_{2,1} &amp; A_{2,2}\\end{array}\\right)\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\ny_{1,t-1} \\\\\ny_{2,t-1} \n\\end{array}\\right) + \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\ne_{1,t} \\\\\ne_{2,t} \n\\end{array}\\right)$$</p>\n\n<p>Here you can see that $y_{1,t}$ has a contribution from its previous value $t_{1,t-1}$ but also includes the value of the other series $y_{2,t-1}$ in a linear combination. As usual, the purpose is to find the elements of $A_{i,j}$ that minimize some measure of error between observed values and estimated values.</p>\n\n<p>A general suggestion: The first thing you need to do is to test the autocorrelation of your first series in order to confirm that an autoregressive approach is suitable and then test the cross correlation between both series to support the idea that using the second series to improve your predictions is appropriate.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<h1>Short Version</h1>\n\n<p>The difference is in the trade-off between complexity of model and how hard it will be to train.  The more states your variable can take, the much more data you'll need to train it.  It sounds like you're reducing the feature space through some front-end processing.</p>\n\n<h1>Example</h1>\n\n<h3>Context:</h3>\n\n<p>Say you're using NBC to model if you go outside given the high temperature that day.  Let's say temperature is given to you as an int in Celsius which just happened to range between 0 and 40 degrees.  Over one year of running the experiment - recording the temperature and if you went outside - you'll have 365 data points.  </p>\n\n<h3>Internal Representation:</h3>\n\n<p>The internal structure the NBC uses will be a matrix with 82 values (41 values for your one input variable * 2 because you have two states in your output class).  That means each bin will have an average of <code>365/82 = 8.9ish</code> samples.  In practice, you'll probably see a few bins with lots more samples than this and a many bins with 0 samples.  </p>\n\n<h3>A Pitfall</h3>\n\n<p>Say you saw 8 cases at a temperature of 5 C (all of which you stayed inside) and nothing at a temp of 3 or 4 C.  If, after the model is built, you 'ask it' what class a temp of 4 C should be in.  It won't know.  Intuitively, we'd say \"stay inside\", but the model won't.  One way to fix this is to bin the classes 0,1,2,... into larger groups of temperatures (i.e., class 0 for temp 0-3, class 1 for temp 4-7, etc).  The extreme case of this would be two temperature states \"high\" and \"low\".  The actual cut-off should depend more on the data observed, but one such scheme is converting temperatures within <code>0-20</code> to \"low\" and <code>21-40</code> is \"high\".  </p>\n\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\n\n<p>This front end processing seems to be what you're talking about as the \"wrapper\" around the NBC.  The result of our \"high\" and \"low\" binning scheme will result in a much smaller model (2 input states and 2 output classes gives you a <code>2*2 = 4</code> number of classes.  This will be way easier to process and will take way less data to confidently train at the expense of complexity.  One example of a drawback of such a scheme is:  Say the actual pattern is that you love spring and fall weather and only go outside when it's not too hot or not too cold.  So your outside adventures are evenly split across the upper part of the \"low\" class and the lower part of the \"high\" class giving you a really useless model.  If this were the case, a 3-class bin scheme of \"high\", \"medium\", and \"low\" would be best.</p>\n",

With the monthly dataset you have 120 data points, which is sufficient to get a timeseries model even with seasonality in your data.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To obtain say weekly or monthly data from daily data, you can use smoothing functions. For financial data, you can use moving average or exponential smoothing, but if those do not work for your data, then you can use the spline smoothing function \"smooth.spline\" in R: <a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/smooth.spline.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/smooth.spline.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The model returned will have less noise than the original daily dataset, and you can get values for the desired time points. Finally, these data points can be used in your timeseries analysis. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To obtain daily data when you have monthly or weekly data, you can use interpolation. First, you should find an equation to describe the data. In order to do this you should plot the data (e.g. price over time). When factors are known to you, this equation should be influenced by those factors. When factors are unknown, you can use a best fit equation. The simplest would be a linear function or piecewise linear function, but for financial data this won't work well. In that case, you should consider piecewise cubic spline interpolation. This link goes into more detail on possible interpolation functions: <a href=\"http://people.math.gatech.edu/~meyer/MA6635/chap2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://people.math.gatech.edu/~meyer/MA6635/chap2.pdf</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In R, there is a method for doing interpolation of timeseries data. Here you would create a vector with say weekly values and NAs in the gaps for the daily values, and then use the \"interpNA\" function to get the interpolated values for the NAs. However, this function uses the \"approx\" function to get the interpolated values, which applies either a linear or constant interpolation. To perform cubic spline interpolation in R, you should use the \"splinefun\" function instead.</p>\n\n<p>Something to be aware of is that timeseries models typically do some sort of averaging to forecast future values whether you are looking at exponential smoothing or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods amongst others. So a timeseries model to forecast daily values may not be the best choice, but the weekly or monthly models may be better. </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Given non-linearity of neural networks, I believe correlation analysis isn't a good way to estimate importance of variables. For example, imagine that you have 2 input variables - <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> - and following conditions hold: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>cor(x2, y) = 1</code> if <code>x1 = 1</code></li>\n<li><code>cor(x2, y) = 0</code> otherwise</li>\n<li><code>x1 = 1</code> in 10% of cases</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That is, <code>x2</code> is a very good predictor for <code>y</code>, but only given that <code>x1 = 1</code>, which is the case only in 10% of data. Taking into account correlations of <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> separately won't expose this dependency, and you will most likely drop out both variables. </p>\n\n<p>There are other ways to perform feature selection, however. Simplest one is to train your model with all possible sets of variables and check the best subset. This is pretty inefficient with many variables, though, so many ways to improve it exist. For a good introduction in best subset selection see chapter 6.1 of <a href=\"http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>. </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>There is no ideal configuration, for <code>R</code> or in general - product selection is always a difficult task and many factors are at play. I think that the solution is rather simple - get the best computer that your budget allows.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, since you want to focus on <code>R</code> development and one of <code>R</code>'s pressing issues is its <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/5171593/2872891\">critical dependence</a> on the amount of available <em>physical memory</em> (RAM), I would suggest favoring more RAM to other parameters. The second most important parameter, in my opinion, would be <em>number of cores</em> (or <em>processors</em> - see details below), due to your potential <em>multiprocessing</em> focus. Finally, the two next most important criteria I'd pay attention to would be <em>compatibility</em> with Linux and system/manufacturer's <em>quality</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the <em>storage</em> goes, I suggest considering <em>solid state drives (SSD)</em>, if you'd rather prefer to have a bit more more speed than more space (however, if your work will involve intensive disk operations, you might want to investigate the issue of SSD <em>reliability</em> or consult with people, knowledgeable in this matter). However, I think that for R-focused work, disk operations are much less critical than memory ones, as I've mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>When choosing a specific <em>Linux distribution</em>, I suggest using a well-supported one, such as Debian or, even better, Ubuntu (if you care more about support, choose their LTS version). I'd rather not buy parts and assemble custom box, but some people would definitely prefer that route - for that you really need to know hardware well, but potential compatibility could still be an issue. The next paragraph provides some examples for both <em>commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)</em> and <em>custom</em> solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Should you be interested in the <em>custom system</em> route, <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/295552-28-multiprocessor-multicore-system-rendering-workstation\" rel=\"nofollow\">this discussion</a> might be worth reading, as it contains some interesting pricing numbers (just to get an idea of potential savings) and also sheds some light on <em>multiprocessor vs. multi-core</em> alternatives (obviously, the <em>context</em> is different, but nevertheless could be useful). As I said, I would go the COTS route, mainly due to reliability and compatibility issues. In terms of single-processor multi-core systems, your budget is more than enough. However, when we go to multiprocessor workstations (I'm not even talking about servers), even two-processor configurations can go over your budget easily. Some, not far away, such as <a href=\"http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/workstations/z820.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP Z820 Workstation</a>. It starts from 2439 USD, but in minimal configuration. When you upgrade it to match your desired specs (if it's even possible), I'm sure that we'll be talking about 5K USD price range (extrapolating from the series' higher-level models). What I like about HP Z820, though, is the fact that this system is <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201011-6754\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubuntu certified</a>. Considering system compatibility and assuming your desire to run Ubuntu, the best way to approach your problem is to go through <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/certification\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubuntu-certified hardware lists</a> and shortlist systems that you like. Just for the sake of completeness, take a look at this <a href=\"http://www.mediaworkstations.net/i-x2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">interesting multiprocessor system</a>, which in compatible configuration might cost less than from HP or other major vendors. However, it's multimedia-oriented as well as it's reliability and compatibility are unknown, not to mention that it's way over your specified budget.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of <code>R</code> and <code>R</code>-focused software, I highly recommend you to use <em>RStudio Server</em> instead of <em>RStudio</em>, as that will provide you with an opportunity to be able to work from any Internet-enabled location (provided you computer will be running, obviously). Another advice that I have is to keep an eye on <em>alternative <code>R</code> distributions</em>. I'm not talking about commercial expensive ones, but about emerging open source projects, such as <code>pqR</code>: <a href=\"http://www.pqr-project.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pqr-project.org</a>. Will update as needed. I hope this is helpful.</p>\n",

If there are more buyer initiated trades in a given second, then that second's data point would contain a positive value in the pertinent feature. If there are more seller initiated trades, then there would be a negative value. And if either there is an equal amount of buy vs seller initiated trades OR if there are simply not any trades in a given second, there will be a 0 for the feature in that data point. Along with this feature, there are several other features that are based on what occurred in the preceding seconds (eg if the value discussed above was 12 for the data point immediately preceding the current point, then the second feature for the current data point would be 12 - please let me know if this is not clear) After much troubleshooting, I have concluded that if there are too many data points with too many 0's for features, the classifier simply wont work. When I print out the probabilities of evaluation data points falling into different classes, I simply get</p>\n\n<pre><code>0:NaN,1:NaN\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>for all model evaluation points I try to classify.

You can perform naive summations of keyword mappings counts, look at keyword likelihoods in the normalized distributions, or give a distribution of weighting based on the strongest matches.

                "_Body": "<h3>Why to use deep networks?</h3>\n\n<p>Let's first try to solve very simple classification task. Say, you moderate a web forum which is sometimes flooded with spam messages. These messages are easily identifiable - most often they contain specific words like \"buy\", \"porn\", etc. and a URL to outer resources. You want to create filter that will alert you about such suspecious messages. It turns to be pretty easy - you get list of features (e.g. list of suspicious words and presence of a URL) and train simple logistic regression (a.k.a. perceptron), i.e. model like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>g(w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wnxn)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>x1..xn</code> are your features (either presence of specific word or a URL), <code>w0..wn</code> - learned coefficients and <code>g()</code> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\">logistic function</a> to make result be between 0 and 1. It's very simple classifier, but for this simple task it may give very good results, creating linear decision boundary. Assuming you used only 2 features, this boundary may look something like this: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.mblondel.org/images/perceptron_linear.png\" alt=\"linear boundary\"></p>\n\n<p>Here 2 axes represent features (e.g. number of occurrences of specific word in a message, normalized around zero), red points stay for spam and blue points - for normal messages, while black line shows separation line. </p>\n\n<p>But soon you notice that some good messages contain a lot of occurrences of word \"buy\", but no URLs, or extended discussion of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/713247/what-is-the-best-way-to-programatically-detect-porn-images\">porn detection</a>, not actually refferring to porn movies. Linear decision boundary simply cannot handle such situations. Instead you need something like this: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/courses/MachineLearning/exercises/ex8materials/ex8b_100.png\" alt=\"non-linear boundary\"></p>\n\n<p>This new non-linear decision boundary is much more <strong>flexible</strong>, i.e. it can fit the data much closer. There are many ways to achieve this non-linearity - you can use polynomial features (e.g. <code>x1^2</code>) or their combination (e.g. <code>x1*x2</code>) or project them out to a higher dimension like in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method\">kernel methods</a>. But in neural networks it's common to solve it by <strong>combining perceptrons</strong> or, in other words, by building <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron\"><strong>multilayer perceptron</strong></a>. Non-linearity here comes from logistic function between layers. The more layers, the more sophisticated patterns may be covered by MLP. Single layer (perceptron) can handle simple spam detection, network with 2-3 layers can catch tricky combinations of features, and networks of 5-9 layers, used by large research labs and companies like Google, may model the whole language or detect cats on images. </p>\n\n<p>This is essential reason to have <strong>deep architectures</strong> - they can <em>model more sophisticated patterns</em>. </p>\n\n<h3>Why deep networks are hard to train?</h3>\n\n<p>With only one feature and linear decision boundary it's in fact enough to have only 2 training examples - one positive and one negative. With several features and/or non-linear decision boundary you need several orders more examples to cover all possible cases (e.g. you need not only find examples with <code>word1</code>, <code>word2</code> and <code>word3</code>, but also with all possible their combinations). And in real life you need to deal with hundreds and thousands of features (e.g. words in a language or pixels in an image) and at least several layers to have enough non-linearity. Size of a data set, needed to fully train such networks, easily exceeds 10^30 examples, making it totally impossible to get enough data. In other words, with many features and many layers our decision function becomes <strong>too flexible</strong> to be able to learn it <strong>precisely</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>There are, however, ways to learn it <em>approximately</em>. For example, if we were working in probabilistic settings, then instead of learning frequencies of all combinations of all features we could assume that they are independent and learn only individual frequencies, reducing full and unconstrained <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier\">Bayes classifier</a> to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier\">Naive Bayes</a> and thus requiring much, much less data to learn. </p>\n\n<p>In neural networks there were several attempts to (meaningfully) reduce complexity (flexibility) of decision function. For example, convolutional networks, extensively used in image classification, assume only local connections between nearby pixels and thus try only learn combinations of pixels inside small \"windows\" (say, 16x16 pixels = 256 input neurons) as opposed to full images (say, 100x100 pixels = 10000 input neurons). Other approaches include feature engineering, i.e. searching for specific, human-discovered descriptors of input data. </p>\n\n<p>Manually discovered features are very promising actually. In natural language processing, for example, it's sometimes helpful to use special dictionaries (like those containing spam-specific words) or catch negation (e.g. \"<em>not</em> good\"). And in computer vision things like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SURF\">SURF descriptors</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features\">Haar-like features</a> are almost irreplaceable. </p>\n\n<p>But the problem with manual feature engineering is that it takes literally years to come up with good descriptors. Moreover, these features are often specific </p>\n\n<h3>Unsupervised pretraining</h3>\n\n<p>But it turns out that we can <em>obtain good features automatically</em> right from the data using such algorithms as <strong>autoencoders</strong> and <strong>restricted Boltzmann machines</strong>. I described them in detail in my other <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114385/what-is-the-difference-between-convolutional-neural-networks-restricted-boltzma/117188#117188\">answer</a>, but in short they allow to <strong>find repeated patterns in the input data</strong> and transform it into higher-level features. For example, given only row pixel values as an input, these algorithms may identify and pass higher whole edges, then from these edges construct figures and so on, until you get really high-level descriptors like variations in faces. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oGBRR.jpg\" alt=\"deep learning\"></p>\n\n<p>After such (unsupervised) pretraining network is usually converted into MLP and used for normal supervised training. Note, that pretraining is done layer-wise. This significantly reduces solution space for learning algorithm (and thus number of training examples needed) as it only needs to learn parameters <em>inside</em> each layer without taking into account other layers. </p>\n\n<h3>And beyond...</h3>\n\n<p>Unsupervised pretraining have been here for some time now, but recently other algorithms were found to improve learning both - together with pretraining and without it. One notable example of such algorithms is <a href=\"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf\"><strong>dropout</strong></a> - simple technique, that randomly \"drops out\" some neurons during training, creatig some distortion and preventing networks of following data too closely. This is still a hot research topic, so I leave this to a reader. </p>\n",

It is then possible to inspect this model to figure out how it works, what it judged was more important.

The dataset was created, according to the article, like this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now he’d do the same for love. First he’d need data. While his\n  dissertation work continued to run on the side, he set up 12 fake\n  OkCupid accounts and wrote a Python script to manage them. The script\n  would search his target demographic (heterosexual and bisexual women\n  between the ages of 25 and 45), visit their pages, and scrape their\n  profiles for every scrap of available information: ethnicity, height,\n  smoker or nonsmoker, astrological sign—“all that crap,” he says.</p>\n  \n  <p>To find the survey answers, he had to do a bit of extra sleuthing.\n  OkCupid lets users see the responses of others, but only to questions\n  they’ve answered themselves. McKinlay set up his bots to simply answer\n  each question randomly—he wasn’t using the dummy profiles to attract\n  any of the women, so the answers didn’t mat­ter—then scooped the\n  women’s answers into a database. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he used python scripts to collect lots of information! At the end of this, he had a table of data, where each row had three pieces of information:\n- A bot's answer to all the questions, and their weights\n- A woman's answer to all the questions\n- Their match percentage. </p>\n\n<p>On this, he could use AdaBoost to create a predictive model, predicting the match percentage from the available information. The weak learners were probably decision stumps, greedily choosing one variable at a time to split on, that's the standard that people refer to when talking about AdaBoost. </p>\n\n<p>Once the predictive model, was in place, it could be used for optimization - determining which weights to put on the questions when holding all other variables constant, maximizing the average match percentage to women in his target audience. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is just a guess. The article doesn't have much detail. But it's a potential way to use AdaBoost for that purpose. </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p><strong>Feature Generation</strong> -- This is the process of taking raw, unstructured data and defining features (i.e. variables) for potential use in your statistical analysis. For instance, in the case of text mining you may begin with a raw log of thousands of text messages (e.g. SMS, email, social network messages, etc) and generate features by removing low-value words (i.e. stopwords), using certain size blocks of words (i.e. n-grams) or applying other rules.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feature Extraction</strong> -- After generating features, it is often necessary to test transformations of the original features and select a subset of this pool of potential original and derived features for use in your model (i.e. feature extraction and selection). Testing derived values is a common step because the data may contain important information which has a non-linear pattern or relationship with your outcome, thus the importance of the data element may only be apparent in its transformed state (e.g. higher order derivatives). Using too many features can result in multiply colinearity or otherwise confound statistical models, whereas extracting the minimum number of features to suit the purpose of your analysis follows the principal of parsimony.</p>\n\n<p><em>Enhancing your feature space</em> in this way is often a necessary step in classification of images or other data objects because the raw feature space is typically filled with an overwhelming amount of unstructured and irrelevant data that comprises what's often referred to as \"noise\" in the paradigm of a \"signal\" and \"noise\" (which is to say that some data has predictive value and other data does not). By enhancing the feature space you can better identify the important data which has predictive or other value in your analysis (i.e. the \"signal\") while removing confounding information (i.e. \"noise\").</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>Some notes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In the case of supervised learning you assume there is a function $f:\\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$, which means there is a connection somehow between inputs and outputs and you want to use it in order to predict. But how this function might look? Without considering the model itself, usually what happens is that there is some noise. And this noise can be in $Y$ and also can be in $X$. This noise gives use the probabilistic setup of the problem, because without it we would have only to solve some equations. </p></li>\n<li><p>Now is important to understand that the noise defines the distribution. So a random variable can be imagined as a function having something fixed and well defined and something not fixed, but taking values according with a distribution. If the variable part does not exist, that you would not have a random variable, right, it would be a simple formula. But its not. Now the $P(X)$ incorporates what happens in $X$ alone, and $P(Y)$ what is in $Y$ alone. When you predict the decision theory says that you are interested in saying which is the most probable value $y_i$ given some input value $x_i$. So you are interested in finding $P(Y|X)$.</p></li>\n<li><p>A joint probability is not always completely described by marginal probabilities. In fact, is completely described only when marginal probabilities are independent. Which means for r.v. $X, Y$ knowing $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ does not put you in position to know the joint density $P(X, Y)$ (thought for independence you have  $P(X,Y)=P(X)P(Y)$). </p></li>\n<li><p>From here you can go directly and try to estimate $P(Y|X)$. In fact if your only interest in only in prediction, this might be a fair bet. A lot of supervised learning algorithms tries to estimate directly this probability. They are called discriminant classifiers. The reason is because they are used to classify something to  the class with maximal conditional probability, you discriminate (choose) the maximum value. </p></li>\n<li><p>Now arriving at your question. Notice the obvious $P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X)$ than you see that by trying learning the joint probability, you also learn the conditional (what you need for prediction). This kind of approach is called generative, because knowing the joint probability you can not only predict, but you can generate new data for your problem. More than that, knowing the join probability can give you more insights related with how what are you model works. You can find such kind of information which is not contained only in marginal distributions. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some final notes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Technically you do not minimize the error function, but it's expectation. The error function remains as it is.</li>\n<li>$\\mathcal{Z}$ is only a domain it's impossible to describe a probability only by it's domain. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's late, I hope I was not completely incoherent.</p>\n",

At the end of the day, all the information you have right now is that \"GBT did not work well for this prediction problem and this metric\", summed up by a single RMSE comparison. This isn't very much information - it could be that this is a bad dataset for GBT and some \nother model would work, it could be that the label can't be predicted from these features with any model, or there could be some error in model setup/validation. </p>\n\n<p>I'd recommend checking the following hypotheses: </p>\n\n<p>1) Maybe, with your dataset size and the features you have, GBT isn't a very high-performance model. Try something completely different - maybe just a simple linear regression! Or a random forest. Or GBDT with very different parameter settings. Or something else. This will help you diagnose whether it's an issue with choice of models or with something else; if a few very different approaches give you roughly similar results, you'll know that it's not the model choice that is causing these results, and if one of those models behaves differently, then that gives you additional information to help diagnose the issue. </p>\n\n<p>2) Maybe there's some issue with model setup and validation? I would recommend doing some exploration to get some intuition as to whether the RMSE you're getting is reasonable or whether you should expect better. Your post contained very little detail about what the data actually represents, what you know about the features and labels, etc. Perhaps you know those things but didn't include them here, but if not, you should go back and try to get additional understanding of the data before continuing. Look at some random data points, plot the columns against the target, look at the histograms of your features and labels, that sort of thing. There's no substitute for looking at the data. </p>\n\n<p>3) Maybe there just aren't enough data points to justify complex models. When you have low numbers of data points (&lt; 100), a simpler parametric model built with domain expertise and knowledge of what the features are may very well outperform a nonparametric model.  </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>I agree with @geogaffer. This is a very good list, indeed. However, I see some <em>issues</em> with this list as it is currently formulated. For example, one issue is that suggested solutions are of different <strong>granularity levels</strong> - some of them represent <em>approaches</em>, some - <em>methods</em>, some - <em>algorithms</em>, and some other - just <em>concepts</em> (in other words, <em>terms</em> within a topic's domain terminology). In addition, - and I believe that this is much more important than the above - I think that it would be much valuable, if all those solutions in the list were arranged within a <strong>unified thematic statistical framework</strong>. This idea was inspired by reading an excellent book by Lisa Harlow \"The essence of multivariate thinking\". Hence, recently I've initiated a corresponding, albeit currently somewhat limited, <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/131320/31372\">discussion</a> on the StackExchange's <em>Cross Validated</em> site. Don't let the title confuse you - my implied intention and hope is for building a <em>unified framework</em>, as mentioned above.</p>\n",

This produces several versions (one for each scale $k\\sigma$) of your image $I(x,y)$ with different degrees of blurring.</p></li>\n<li><p>Separate your blurred images according to octaves (an octave is usually taken as $2\\sigma$). Within a given octave, take the difference between adjacent blurred images $L(x,y,k_{i}\\sigma)$ and  $L(x,y,k_{j}\\sigma)$. This difference is called a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) $D(x,y,\\sigma) = L(x,y,k_{i}\\sigma) - L(x,y,k_{j}\\sigma)$. At this point, an image will be helpful (source: <a href=\"http://docs.opencv.org/master/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_sift_intro/py_sift_intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">opencv</a>):</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yLVAi.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, you have the blurred/convolved/filtered images on the left and the differences between adjacent images on the right.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Then, take one pixel on a DoG and compare it to its 8 neighbors in the same DoG, as well as to the 9 equivalent pixels of the DoG located in the next scale  and to the other 9 pixels in the previous DoG. In the drawing, this corresponds to the DoG's located above and below. If this pixel is a local extrema, then you have a candidate keypoint. Keep in mind that candidates can be discarded based on other criteria.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you have these keypoints, you proceed to generate descriptors. For each keypoint, calculate an image gradient. As you should know, gradients tell you the direction of maximum rate of change. Therefore, you can construct a grid around each keypoint that is oriented according to the dominant gradient around that point. This grid has subregions (usually 16 subregions) and for each subregion, calculate an 8-bin histogram. Finally, concatenate every histogram you obtained from every subregion in your grid and that is the feature vector for that keypoint (actually, the full feature vector also includes the location and rotation angle.)

Of course, there are several options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create an array datatype to store your data</li>\n<li>Simply use a VARCHAR field</li>\n<li>Store it as a binary file</li>\n<li>Use a database specifically designed to handle arrays.</li>\n</ol>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>This is very <strong>broad</strong> question, which I think it's impossible to cover <em>comprehensively</em> in a single answer. Therefore, I think that it would be more beneficial to provide some pointers to relevant answers and/or resources. This is exactly what I will do by providing the following information and thoughts of mine.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I should mention the excellent and comprehensive <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/150728/FnT_dimensionReduction.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tutorial on dimensionality reduction</a> by Burges (2009) from Microsoft Research. He touches on <em>high-dimensional aspects</em> of data frequently throughout the monograph. This work, referring to <em>dimensionality reduction</em> as <em>dimension reduction</em>, presents a theoretical introduction into <strong>the problem</strong>, suggests a <strong>taxonomy</strong> of dimensionality reduction methods, consisting of <em>projective methods</em> and <em>manifold modeling methods</em>, as well as provides an <strong>overview</strong> of multiple methods in each category.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<strong>projective</strong> pursuit\" methods reviewed include <em>independent component analysis (ICA)</em>, <em>principal component analysis (PCA)</em> and its variations, such as <em>kernel PCA</em> and <em>probabilistic PCA</em>, <em>canonical correlation analysis (CCA)</em> and its <em>kernel CCA</em> variation, <em>linear discriminant analysis (LDA)</em>, <em>kernel dimension reduction (KDR)</em> and some others. The <strong>manifold</strong> methods reviewed include <em>multidimensional scaling (MDS)</em> and its <em>landmark MDS</em> variation, <em>Isomap</em>, <em>Locally Linear Embedding</em> and graphical methods, such as <em>Laplacian eigenmaps</em> and <em>spectral clustering</em>. I'm listing the most of the reviewed methods here in case, if the original publication is inaccessible for you, either <em>online</em> (link above), or <em>offline</em> (References).</p>\n\n<p>There is a <strong>caveat</strong> for the term \"comprehensive\" that I've applied to the above-mentioned work. While it is indeed rather comprehensive, this is relative, as some of the approaches to dimensionality reduction are not discussed in the monograph, in particular, the ones, focused on <em>unobservable (latent) variables</em>. Some of them are mentioned, though, with references to another source - a book on dimensionality reduction.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I will briefly cover several narrower aspects of the topic in question by referring to my relevant or related answers. In regard to <em>nearest neighbors (NN)-type approaches</em> to high-dimensional data, please see my answers <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/975/2452\">here</a> (I especially recommend to check the paper #4 in my list). One of the effects of the <em>curse of dimensionality</em> is that high-dimensional data is frequently <strong>sparse</strong>. Considering this fact, I believe that my relevant answers <a href=\"http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2452\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/130665/31372\">here</a> on <strong>regression</strong> and <strong>PCA</strong> for <em>sparse and high-dimensional data</em> might be helpful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>Burges, C.

Our customers typically uses following monitoring tools to monitor their servers/webapps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>OpsView</li>\n<li>Nagios</li>\n<li>Pingdom</li>\n<li>Custom shell scripts</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Whenever any issue is found, an alert mail comes to our Ops team so that they act upon rectifying the issue.</p>\n\n<p>As we manage thousands of servers, our Ops teams' inbox is flooded with email alerts all the time. Even a single issue which has a cascading effect, can trigger 20-30 emails.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what I want to do is to implement a system which will be able to extract important features out of an alert email - like server IP address, type of problem, severity of problem etc. and also classify the emails into proper category, like <code>CPU-Load-Customer1-Server2, MySQL-Replication-Customer2-DBServer3</code> etc. We will then have a pre-defined set of debugging steps for each category, in order to help the Ops team to rectify the problem faster. Also, the feature extractor will provide input data to the team for a problem.</p>\n\n<p>So far I have been able to train <em>NaiveBayesClassifier</em> with supervised learning techniques i.e. labeled training data(cluster data), and able to classify new unseen emails into its proper cluster/category. As the emails are based on certain templates, the accuracy of the classifier is very high. But we also get alert emails from custom scripts, which may not follow the templates. So, instead of doing supervised learning, I want to try out unsupervised learning for the same. I am looking into <em>KMeans clustering</em>. But again the problem is, we won't know the number of clusters beforehand. <strong>So, which algorithm will be best for this use case?</strong> Right now I am using Python's TextBlob library for classification.</p>\n\n<p>Also, for feature extraction out of an alert email, I am looking into NLTK (<a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html\">http://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html</a>) library. I tried it out, but it seems to work on proper English paragraphs/texts well, however, for alert emails, it extracted a lot of unnecessary features. <strong>Is there already any existing solution for the same? If not, what will be the best way to implement the same?

While EFA is frequently performed independently (and maybe that's enough for your purposes), doing it along with CFA represents a large part of LVM/SEM methodology, which is usually completed by performing <em>path analysis</em>, which is concerned about relationships between latent variables.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>R</code> <em>ecosystem</em> offers a variety of <strong>packages</strong> for performing LVM/SEM in its entirety or for performing EFA, CFA and path analysis.

The fact that electrical consumption is often bi-modal is another problem which isn't solved by a simple transformation. </p>\n\n<p>A possible solution that works rather well is to treat the time of day as a categorical variable. That does the trick, but it suffers from a significant drawback in that there's no information sharing between neighbouring hours.</p>\n\n<p>So what I'm asking is this: does anyone know of a \"soft\" version of categorical values? I'm suggesting something quite loosely defined: Ideally I would have some parameter alpha that reduces the regression to numerical regression where alpha = 1 and reduces to categorical regression where alpha = 0, and behaves \"in between\" if it's some other number. </p>\n\n<p>Right now the only answer I can think of is to alter the weights in the regression in such a way that they tend towards zero the further away the quasi-categorical value is from the desired value.

For example, 4 (so you divide your day hours into 4 cathegories). Instead of computing just 1 number (which defines cluster membership) for each of your day hours you compute 4 numbers which represent the degree of membership to each of 4 clusters. So for example if you 4 clusters will contain periods 12 AM-6 AM, 6 AM- 12 PM, 12 PM - 6 PM and 6 PM - 12 AM then you would replace for example 4 AM hour in original data with vector of 4 numbers, first one is the biggest, second is smaller, third one is the smallest one etc.</p>\n\n<p>Then you could use these 4 numbers in your model to fit a regression line.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you want you could use 24 clusters and in such case each your day of hour would have a high 'relation' with nearby hours and almost 0 with the distant hours.</p>\n",

This talks about increasing the accuracy of candidate pair selection by Amplifying a Locality-Sensitive Family. I think I just about understand the mathematical explanation, but I'm struggling to see how I implement this practically.</p>\n\n<p>What I have so far is as follows</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I have say 1000 movies each with ratings from some selection of 1M users. Each movie is represented by a sparse vector of user scores (row number = user ID, value = user's score)</li>\n<li>I build N random vectors. The vector length matches the length of the movie vectors (i.e. the number of users). The vector values are +1 or -1. I actually encode these vectors as binary to save space, with +1 mapped to 1 and -1 mapped to 0</li>\n<li>I build sketch vectors for each movie by taking the dot product of the movie and each of the N random vectors (or rather, if I create a matrix R by laying the N random vectors horizontally and layering them on top of each other then the sketch for movie m is R*m), then taking the sign of each element in the resulting vector, so I end with a sketch vector for each movie of +1s and -1s, which again I encode as binary. Each vector is length N bits.</li>\n<li>Next I look for similar sketches by doing the following\n<ol>\n<li>I split the sketch vector into b bands of r bits</li>\n<li>Each band of r bits is a number. I combine that number with the band number and add the movie to a hash bucket under that number. Each movie can be added to more than one bucket.</li>\n<li>I then look in each bucket. Any movies that are in the same bucket are candidate pairs.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Comparing this to 3.6.3 of mmds, my AND step is when I look at bands of r bits - a pair of movies pass the AND step if the r bits have the same value. My OR step happens in the buckets: movies are candidate pairs if they are both in any of the buckets.</p>\n\n<p>The book suggests I can \"amplify\" my results by adding more AND and OR steps, but I'm at a loss for how to do this practically as the explanation of the construction process for further layers is in terms of checking pairwise equality rather than coming up with bucket numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone help me understand how to do this?</p>\n",

Do you have reason to suspect that your $X$ values are noisy or that your $y$ values are mislabeled? It is also possible that there is not a strong relationship between any of your features and your targets.  Since your targets are binary, you should look at histograms of each of your features to get a rough sense of the class conditional distributions, i.e. $p(X_1|y=1)$ vs $p(X_1|y=0)$.

                "_Body": "<p>I guess what you are looking for is Differential Word Usage. This method takes two text corpora as input and you can get the list of words which are being used more in one text corpus over the other.</p>\n\n<p>Basically what you need to do is to build a common Term Document Matrix for the corpora you are using and then divide this TDM into two TDMs such that all the document columns from corpus 1 fall in one TDM and all the documents columns form corpus 2 fall in the second TDM.  For example, you have 2 corpora, the first one containing 10 documents and the second one containing 15 documents. You first, combine both these corpora and form 25 document corpus and then form the TDM, where terms become the rows (let's say there are 300 terms) and the 25 documents become the 25 columns. Here the first 10 columns represent the documents of first corpus and the remaining 15 belong to the second corpus. So, you divide this TDM of dimensions <code>300 x 25</code> to two TDMs of dimensions <code>300 x 10</code> and <code>300 x 15</code>. Then you can use <code>Chi-square difference</code> over these TDMs to determine which words are occurring more in one corpus than the other.</p>\n\n<p>A wonderful example has been given regarding this approach by Vik in his blog using Wikileaks corpus and <code>R</code> here: <a href=\"http://www.vikparuchuri.com/blog/finding-word-use-patterns-in-wikileaks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vikparuchuri.com/blog/finding-word-use-patterns-in-wikileaks/</a></p>\n",

From here you could really choose whichever term weighting scheme you like (TF, TF normalized against the length of the document, TF-IDF) and measure your correlation statistic between <em>all these unigrams</em> and the class of interest. You could then produce a ranking based on the correlation coefficients for each term, and take the top-<em>k</em> terms. Some correlation statistics you might try could be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chi-squared</a> (which would measure \"lack of independence\" between terms and a class). There's also a nice implementation of Chi-squared test for feature selection in <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#univariate-feature-selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python's Scikit-Learn</a> machine learning library that may be a place to start for this task. Hopefully, that helps!</p>\n",

I'd like to make several points, which I hope will be useful to you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In terms of the level of <em>programming proficiency</em>, which is expected (needed) for a data scientist, the following popular <strong>definition</strong> says it all:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A <em>data scientist</em> is someone who is better at statistics than any\n  software engineer and better at software engineering than any\n  statistician.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Another perspective on the role of programming abilities in a data scientist's skill set can be found in a popular visual representation of data science, using Venn diagrams. The original <strong>data science Venn diagram</strong> was presented by data scientist Drew Conway (see <a href=\"http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a>):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwWt2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since its original introduction, the original diagram was modified by various people for various reasons. The two interesting <strong>adaptations</strong> are for data science in the social sciences domain (<a href=\"http://www.datascienceassn.org/content/fourth-bubble-data-science-venn-diagram-social-sciences\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.datascienceassn.org/content/fourth-bubble-data-science-venn-diagram-social-sciences</a>), as well as data science Venn diagram V2.0, where data science is represented not as an intersection of knowledge domains, but as their union (<a href=\"http://www.anlytcs.com/2014/01/data-science-venn-diagram-v20.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.anlytcs.com/2014/01/data-science-venn-diagram-v20.html</a>). Another very interesting and useful visual perspective of data science skill set, also based on Venn diagram, is the following Gartner's diagram, <strong>mapping</strong> specific <em>skills</em> to business intelligence (BI) or business analytics <em>knowledge domains</em>:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XBbDM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>An alternative perspective for a data scientist's skill set and domain knowledge is a <strong>taxonomy of data scientists</strong>, such as <a href=\"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/six-categories-of-data-scientists\" rel=\"nofollow\">this taxonomy</a>, which classifies data scientists, according to their <em>focus</em> (or the <em>strongest skill set</em>): mathematics, data engineering, machine learning, business, software engineering, visualization, spacial data (GIS) or others.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you're curious about the meaning of the <strong>\"Danger Zone\"</strong> in the original data science Venn diagram, <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/In-the-data-science-venn-diagram-why-is-the-common-region-of-Hacking-Skills-and-Substantive-Expertise-considered-as-danger-zone\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Quora discussion</a>, containing, among other nice answers, also an answer by the original diagram's author, can be very helpful.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you're interested in learning about a range of <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>knowledge domains</strong>, useful for a data scientist, check this open source <em>curriculum</em> for learning data science: <a href=\"http://datasciencemasters.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://datasciencemasters.org</a>, or on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go</a>. Of course, popular and research papers, lectures on YouTube, MOOC courses, online and offline bootcamps as well as a wealth of other resources is only an Internet search away.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, a note on <strong>programming languages</strong> for data science. I think that it is important to understand that this aspect is really of secondary importance. The <strong>focus</strong> should be on two words, which the term \"data science\" consists of: <em>data</em> and <em>science</em>. <strong>Focus on data</strong> means that it is important to think about data science (or BI, or analytics) tasks in terms of the corresponding <em>domain knowledge</em> as well as to pay attention to <em>data quality</em> and <em>representativeness</em>. <strong>Focus on science</strong> means adhering to <em>scientific approaches</em> to data collection and analysis, of which <em>reproducibility</em> plays an important role. A <em>programming language</em> for data science is just a <strong>tool</strong> and, therefore, should be chosen to match the task at hand. Python and R represent very good and the most popular programming languages and environments for a data scientist, however, you should be aware of other options (<em>tool set</em>).</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

I have a large log of chat sessions between customers and support professionals that I can use. I am wondering what is the best way to go about building this chatbot. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some ideas I have looked into;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first thing I did was to breakdown the chat logs into Q&amp;A pairs. Treat each question as a document, compute a term-document matrix and use it to retrieve the most similar question when a customer asks sometihng. The idea was to then simply pick the answer given to the question by the human (with some modifications). However, this gives really abysmal results and does not match to previous questions very well. Even if I get this approach to work well, we would be limited to the questions that already been asked. </li>\n<li>Another thing I thought about was to modify something like ALICE and write some AIML for customer support related QA. However, that would take a lot of very precise AIML writint to work well. This solution would not be able to scale to other languages, which is something I want to do.</li>\n<li>Another idea I have is to try and cluster the answers given by the customer support staff (they are more likely to be aligned compared to the questions asked by customers). This would give me a sense of what questions are similar. Then I can use something like LSA on the questions and fall back to the first approach.</li>\n<li>Yet another way is to build an ontology of the domain specific knowledge and given a question decide which category the question falls into. The questions from the chat logs can then be mapped to the ontology and I could train classifiers for mapping questions to different knowledge areas. Once I reach the leaf nodes, I can give back pre-defined answers. However, my reservation is that mapping chat logs to the ontology would be very tedious. Is there a good way to map the existing QA to the ontology?</li>\n</ul>\n",

In any case, you don't want to do this because even if you were able to get perfect recognition, some of your lines would be placed in the wrong county because tesseract is looking at your document as a big paragraph. I recommend you to use the vertical lines to segment your image into 3 parts and then preprocess each one of them. You can even try to concatenate the parts vertically and perform OCR in a single page. This also applies to the second image.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the resolution of your image is not great, so if you can get a better image, that is going to make a big difference. </p>\n",

After replacing these with 0.0 it works fine for 1000 x 1000 matrix. And my recommendations are working like a charm. I'll still need compute SVD of 20x more rows and columns. If anyone knows what's the easiest way to compute (approximate) SVD of 20.000 x 20.000 dense matrix, probably through some cloud parallel service (?), please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>PS.

For example, you may get a cluster of \"broken things\" but not to the specificity that is required to be helpful to the customer. A similar approach would be using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, but again, you may not get the clusters that you want.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't be so eager to try your fourth option because it requires a lot of work and I'm not sure you're going to get great results unless your customer support deals with very well-defined questions and in that case, you're going to have to build your own ontology from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>In your situation, I would be curious if I can get information about the inner workings of Watson (obviously, the purpose is only to have a general idea of some steps that are sensible enough to try.) Here is a descriptive image that could be helpful from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_%28computer%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Anu0t.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The main idea is to segment questions into its components (using a regular chunking), then come up with several possibilities (hypothesis generation) of what the question might refer to (maybe this step can be implemented as a clustering). The third stage is rating the previous hypothesis based on available information. Finally, you choose the more likely hypothesis. There is a feedback involved in this process using sample questions and their answers. It would be interesting to see if the rating stage can be modeled in terms of a Bayesian or an incremental approach to allow for a feedback.</p>\n",

Therefore, the short answer to your question is that the <strong>first step should be EDA</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This suggestion is supported by most researchers, regardless of their knowledge domain or type of study. Here is how the father of EDA presents his thoughts on the subject (Tukey, 1977, p. 1-3; emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is detective work – numerical\n  detective work – or counting detective work – or graphical detective\n  work ... unless exploratory data analysis uncovers indications,\n  usually quantitative ones, there is likely to be nothing for\n  confirmatory data analysis to consider ... [it] can never be the whole\n  story, but <strong>nothing else can serve as the foundation stone - as the\n  first step</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is an enormous amount of information on approaches, guidelines and procedures for performing EDA. Potential starting points might include <a href=\"http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/eda.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">EDA page</a> on the NIST's Engineering Statistics Handbook website, <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/caddis/da_exploratory_0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">EDA pages</a> on the EPA's website, <a href=\"http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/309/Book/chapter4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">corresponding chapter</a>  from the book \"Experimental Design for Behavioral and Social Sciences\" and a <a href=\"http://cll.stanford.edu/~langley/cogsys/behrens97pm.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey research paper on EDA</a> by Begrens (1997), among many others. It is interesting to note that some sources include less traditional methods into EDA toolset, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering (for example, see the description of <a href=\"http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290-eda\" rel=\"nofollow\">this research seminar</a>). While some of the EDA approaches and methods are relatively simple, overall EDA is both <strong>art and science</strong>, as it <a href=\"http://community.lithium.com/t5/Science-of-Social-blog/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Playing-with-Big-Data/ba-p/71632\" rel=\"nofollow\">combines unstructured (creative) and structured approaches</a>.

However, I've figured that a wider exposure might help the team to fix this and similar problems faster as well as increase the quality of the <em>machine learning (ML)</em> engine of their website.</p>\n\n<p>The problem exposes itself by too many occurrences of a quite trivial <em>misclassification error</em> on Amazon's book categories <strong>classification</strong> (which I'm a frequent visitor of). In the following example, the underlying reason of such behavior is quite clear, but in other cases the reasons might be different. I am curious about what could be other potential <em>reasons</em> for misclassification and what are the <em>strategies/approaches</em> to avoiding such problems. Without much further ado, here's how the problem appears in real life.</p>\n\n<p>I was reviewing some books, related to transitioning from graduate programs (Ph.D., in particular) to work environment in academia. Among several other books, I ran across the following one:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4LSzV.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So far, so good. However, let's scroll down a bit further to see the the books ratings in relevant categories. We should expect Amazon to figure out <em>categories</em>, <strong>relevant</strong> to the book's <em>discipline, topic and contents</em>. How surprised was I (and that's an understatement!) to see the following result of Amazon.com's sophisticated ML engine and algorithms:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KXrFh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the only fuzzy fact that connects this book with the subject \"Audiology and Speech Pathology\" (!) is IMHO the author's last name (Boice), which, is <strong>close to</strong> the word \"voice\". If my guess is correct, Amazon's ML engine, for some reason, decided to take into account the book's lexicographical attribute instead of the book's most important and <strong>most relevant attributes</strong>, such as title, topic and contents. I've seen multiple occurrences of similar absolutely incorrect ML-based decision making on Amazon.com and some other websites. So, hopefully my question makes sense as well as interesting and important enough to spark a discussion: <strong>What could be other potential reasons for misclassification and what are the strategies/approaches to avoiding such problems?</strong> (Any related thoughts will also be appreciated.)</p>\n",

The network is build up by molecules by matching structural properties and it can be rather complex with many clusters of high degree vertices (ie molecules that are structurally similar to each other). However the representation should give a clear picture of potencies, although high detail accuracy is not required: some sort of classification is adequate. I played with JUNG with a graph having edge weights as the change in potency and the ISOM layout thinking that it reserves (as much as possible) the edge weights but with not good results. Something like radial layout could be ideal, as it gives a clear picture of potency distribution, but this obviously would suffer from crowding of vertices that are closer to the center.  As, obviously, my knowledge is restricted, is there some layout that you would suggest and is practical for a non expert to implement? </p>\n",

For that, I'm first trying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with divergences (Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon) on the per document topic distributions. However, to find # of topics for my corpus ( a 948 document dataset, extracted from larger collection, where docs about the same story are humanly annotated), it was suggested to use HDP. Unfortunately, after MANY tries, I'm still unsure I'm using the packages correctly.</p>\n\n<p>More detailed:</p>\n\n<p>1) HDPFASTER continually increases the number of topics (in train.log file).  What is the stopping criterion (e.g. difference in avg. likelihood between successive iterations smaller than x? which x?) and/or how many cycles should I let it run? Afterwords, do I take as the correct # of topics the last line of \"train.log\" OR should I also test for minimum perplexity (It has also been suggested that Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) might be a better measure) and choose the smallest? If the latter, should I test for ALL iterations?!  Is HDPFASTER's test feature the appropriate tool for this? Last, should I --sample_hyper? Do I just use a(alpha) as input to LDA's prior alpha, perhaps divided by a number (e.g. # of topics)? What about LDA's prior beta? </p>\n\n<p>2) HCA continually decreases  the number of topics (in *.log file). When to stop? Do I accept the final # of topics in .log ( exp.ent =number0) OR do I search for the minimum perplexity of test set (as I assume it appears as number2 in \"log_2(perp)=number1,number2\" in .log throughout iterations), which ALWAYS appears VERY close to my initial max number of topics? Hyperparameters alpha,beta: do I sample using -D , -E? Which do I put as input to LDA's priors? Is it generally worth it?</p>\n\n<p>Generally: Is it possible that my dataset is just too small and/or 'biased/fragmented/incomplete', in the sense that each story has only 1-3 examples, while the diversity of the topics these stories discuss can be quite large? Should I just try and augment it with a larger 'homogeneous' dataset? </p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p><strong>Let me first explain the concept of entropy for decision trees:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Entropy is a so called impurity measure for a set of elements. Impurity - being the opposite of purity - is referring to the distribution of the decision categories (or class labels) within the set. Initially, each row in the table is one element and your set of elements are all rows of your table. This set is called pure if it just consists of the same class label and it is called impure if it contains all different class labels in the same proportion. Translating into the values of entropy (remember being an impurity measure, the set has in the latter case the highest possible value and in the former case (just the same class label) the lowest value. The lowest possible value for entropy is 0.   </p>\n\n<p>So let's choose a visual respresentation to illustrate what really counts and what does not matter for the entropy. </p>\n\n<p>1) You start off with the initial table which contains the following class labels:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CbjbT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Please note that for computing the entropy none of the remaining attributes, attribute values matter, also the order of the rows don't matter (entropy is a measure for a set of elements)</p>\n\n<p>2) You convert the different class labels to different colors</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/A4mux.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>3) So instead of this table with the colored class labeled, you just draw a circle (\"ball\") for each class label (=element)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ufvDS.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Now you throw all the balls in a bag. There you go! Your elements of a set are represented as balls in a bag.  If you open the bag and look into it, you might see </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>just balls of the same color --> one pure color. The entropy says, it's not impure at all, I give it a zero! entropy = 0</li>\n<li>the same amount of balls in different colors --> that doesn't look pure at all, it's impure! The entropy assigns the highest possible value to this set (bag). The highest possible entropy value depends on the number of class labels. If you have just two, the maximum entropy is 1. In your case, you have 4 different class labels, so the maximum entropy would be e.g. if you had 12 balls and 3 balls of each color. The maximum entropy of a 4 class set is 2.</li>\n<li>none of the above. Then your entropy is between the two values. If one color is dominant then the entropy will be close to 0, if the colors are very mixed up, then it is close to the maximum (2 in your case).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>How does a decision tree use the entropy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, first you calculate the entropy of the whole set. That impurity is your reference. What your decision tree tries to achieve is to reduce the impurity of the whole set. So the information Gain for a given attribute is computed by taking the entropy of the whole set and subtracting it with the entropies of sets that are obtained by breaking the whole set into one piece per attribute category. To make sure a set with just a few elements don't get the same weight as a set with many elements the entropies of sets are multiplied by their relative frequency.</p>\n\n<p>Coming back to the example, for computing the Gain (S, parents) you need to compute the weighted entropies of the two sets: set 1 = all rows with category(parent) = yes and set 2 = all rows with category(parent) = no).</p>\n\n<p>Set 1 refers to five rows, all having the decision category = cinema(just 5 orange balls!)\nSo the weight is 5 rows out of 10 rows = 5/10 = 0.5. And the entropy is 0 (totally pure) or by applying the formula:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dDMBf.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>You have a sum over all class labels so n = 4. So you assign a class label to each of the i's. E.g.</p>\n\n<p>For i = 1 being cinema: - (5/5 * log(3/3) = - (1 * log(1)) = - (1*0) = 0</p>\n\n<p>For i = 2 being tennis: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0</p>\n\n<p>For i = 3 being stay in: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0</p>\n\n<p>For i = 4 being shopping: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0</p>\n\n<p>So the sum of all four is 0. 0 times the weight 0.5 equals 0.</p>\n\n<p>Set 2 also refers to five rows, having the decision categories = 1*cinema, 2*tennis, 1*stay in, 1*shopping\nSo the weight is also 5 rows out of 10 rows = 5/10 = 0.5. Applying the formula:</p>\n\n<p>For i = 1 being cinema: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46</p>\n\n<p>For i = 2 being tennis: - (2/5 * log(2/5) = - (0.4 * -1,32) = 0.53</p>\n\n<p>For i = 3 being stay in: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46</p>\n\n<p>For i = 4 being shopping: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46</p>\n\n<p>So the sum of all four is 1.92. 1.92 times the weight 0.5 = 0.96.\nThus, the Gain for this attribute is: \nInitial entropy - weighted entropies for all attribute categories:\n1.57 - 0 - 0.96 = 0.61.</p>\n\n<p>For the other attributes you do the same calculation.</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>The answer to both data sets is an OCR application with some post-processing, but a more specialized program than a generic low-quality or an open source OCR. Essentially the harder the problem, the more capable and advanced tools need to be used to solve it.</p>\n\n<p>There will be two major stages in this task: digitizing the data (image to text, i.e. OCR) and processing the data (performing the actual count). Look at them separately in order to select the best method for each stage.</p>\n\n<p>The main challenges in these images and generic OCR are:</p>\n\n<p>a) images have low resolution. For example the # 1 image has resolution of about 72 dpi. Suggested resolution for such text quality is to scan at 300 to 400 dpi, but it is clear that re-scanning or controlling scan resolution is not applicable now. That’s why one option is to clean and increase the size using image pre-processing tools. This is what the original #1 image snippet looks like after adaptive binarization and zoomed at 300%. It is clear that each character has too few pixels and characters can be easily misread.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oNqPE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>b) GIF format in #1 is not supported by many OCR applications. Images need to be batch-converted to a different format, such as PNG or TIF.</p>\n\n<p>c) in these scans the backgrounds and bleed-through (shadow from the text on the other side of the paper) is visible. Good binarization needs to be used to remove background and bleed-through, but not remove vital parts of actual characters.</p>\n\n<p>After implementing specific pre-processing solutions for the items listed above, and then using a high quality OCR system, such as www.ocr-it.com API, highest possible results can be achieved.  Result is far from perfect, but it is as high accuracy as it could be achieved with a modern OCR engine on these images.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/v5biL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Luckily for this project, the data needs to be counted, so the second stage has all necessary data for reliable data post-processing analysis. Contrary to other basic OCR engines, the OCR provided by <a href=\"http://www.ocr-it.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ocr-it.com</a> API, which I used to produce the above recognition.  OCR-IT API is free to develop with, and very inexpensive to use per page, so that may be a very economical but powerful solution for this project.  It returns formatted text layout, including preserving line breaks and overall format structure.  This makes text post-processing easier.  </p>\n\n<p>A simple algorithm can be run to count the number of lines, resulting in the necessary for the research count.</p>\n\n<p>The above describes a two-stage approach: getting best possible OCR result, and using an applicable method to process data for the required task</p>\n\n<p>Bat wait, there is more…</p>\n\n<p>There is a second option to use an even more specialized OCR application called <a href=\"http://www.wisetrend.com/abbyy-flexicapture/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FlexiCapture</a> with FlexiLayout technology.  This powerful and intelligent data capture technology has built-in high-accuracy OCR, and it has a powerful rules and data analytics engine to perform very specialized user-defined chains of actions and tasks.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation of this method using FlexiCapture with FlexiLayout takes the following logical steps.</p>\n\n<p>First, full page OCR is performed and all objects are extracted, including characters, noise, black horizontal and vertical lines, white gaps, and objects (which could be pictures, logos, handwriting, etc.).  This produces objects upon which we can apply our search criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the following constraints are applied to the post-OCR data analysis and search criteria: separate image into three vertical columns and run the following logic per column, use line-start as individual count, skip header/footer/indented lines (county names), assume each name to have at least three characters, find recursively every name starting from top to bottom in every column, exclude previously found lines.</p>\n\n<p>While the above logic sounds complex to setup, the actual setup takes just a few minutes and requires minimal work through user interface (UI) environment.  No coding or programming is necessary.   The following search elements and criteria have been created.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MOPHu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>RepeatingGroup consisting of a CharacterString search object.</p>\n\n<p>This setup produces the following search result for the first column of data:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KzpKF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>As the last step, FlexiCapture is instructed to return the number of total found elements that fit our search criteria, effectively producing the necessary data for the research task.</p>\n\n<p>There are other logic alternatives that can be setup in FlexiCapture, such as finding the number of white spaces between lines, or searching for the fixed-length fixed-placement 3-letter combinations at the end of every column linen.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, there are several options (which is always nice) how this task can be achieved with relative ease in effort and high quality, but the success depends on the quality of tools used and necessary knowledge how to use them.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe some of these tools and processes can be beneficial to your project, please contact my directly.  I specialize in these workflows.  Ilya @ WiseTREND.  My company may be able to help with the setup or guidance.  We have participated in various research initiatives, some through donations to a good cause.</p>\n",

Even if that is not the case, Naive Bayes may be useful as a first step; the information you obtain by analyzing Naive Bayes' results, and by further data analysis, will help you to choose which classification algorithm you could try next.

                "_Body": "<p>I also found confusing the definition of likelihood the first time I encountered it. The only thing you need to remember is that likelihood refers to the probability of your data given a parameter. That is,</p>\n\n<p>$$L(\\theta| X) = P(X|\\theta)$$</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the likelihood focuses on the parameter, so you're asking \"What is the likelihood of this parameter given some observations?\" In this case, the phrase \"given some observation\" assumes the observations $X$ are fixed and the parameter $\\theta$ is not fixed. On the other hand, if you describe the same in terms of probability, you're trying to measure the probability of some observations $X$ given a fixed parameter $\\theta$. It is only a matter of usage. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of logistic regression, the likelihood function is described as:</p>\n\n<p>$$L(\\beta| y) = \\prod_{i}^{N} \\pi_{i}^{y_{i}}(1-\\pi_{i})^{n_{i} - y_{i}}$$</p>\n\n<p>where $\\beta$ is the vector of parameters $\\{\\pi_{i}| i=1,...,N \\}$and $y$ is the vector of Bernoulli variables. As you can see, this is the same (by definition) as $P(y|\\beta)$ and that is what you have in the equation above: The product of the probabilities for each observation $y_{i}$ given its parameter $\\pi_{i}$. As usual, each probability $\\pi_{i}$ is equal to the inverse of the logit function.</p>\n\n<p>In Naive Bayes, you have the same basic idea. The likelihood is defined as $L(p_{k}|x) = \\prod_{i}^{N}p_{ki}^{x_{i}}(1-p_{ki})^{(1-x_{i})}$ where $p_{k}$ is a vector of parameters describing the probabilities of a class $k$ generating a word $x_{i}$).</p>\n\n<p>In the EM algorithm, the likelihood is again $L(\\theta|X,Z)$, where $\\theta$ are your parameters, $X$ your observations and $Z$ are latent variables. The fact that you have a latent variables shouldn't confuse you, because this variable will be \"integrated out\"  in the expectation step of the algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>In the previous equations, the calculation you need to do is self-evident if you think about it starting from your observations: First, I have some observations. Then I want to calculate the probability of obtaining these observation using some model. Most models require parameters to be fitted. So I want to calculate the probability of these observations given those parameters. That is, $p(X|\\theta)$. Now, if you need to talk about likeliihood, then you simply write $L(\\theta|X)$.</p>\n",

Essentially, it would be a simple look-up table.</p>\n\n<p>You tell the model what attributes each piece of data has and it simply remembers it and does nothing more with it. If you give it a piece of data that it's seen before, it looks it up and simply regurgitates what you told it earlier. If you give it data it <em>hasn't</em> seen before, the outcome is unpredictable or random. But the point of machine learning isn't to tell you what happened, it's to understand the patterns and use those patterns to predict what's going on.</p>\n\n<p>So think of a decision tree. If you keep growing your decision tree bigger and bigger, eventually you'll wind up with a tree in which every leaf node is based on exactly one data point. You've just found a backdoor way of creating a look-up table.</p>\n\n<p>In order to generalize your results to figure out what might happen in the future, you must create a model that generalizes what's going on in your training set. Overfit models do a great job of describing the data you already have, but descriptive models are not necessarily predictive models.</p>\n\n<p>The No Free Lunch Theorem says that no model can outperform any other model on the set of all <em>possible</em> instances. If you want to predict what will come next in the sequence of numbers \"2, 4, 16, 32\" you can't build a model more accurate than any other if you don't make the assumption that there's an underlying pattern. A model that's overfit isn't really evaluating the patterns - it's simply modeling what it knows is possible and giving you the observations. You get predictive power by assuming that there is some underlying function and that if you can determine what that function is, you can predict the outcome of events. But if there really is no pattern, then you're out of luck and all you can hope for is a look-up table to tell you what you know is possible.</p>\n",

It's overkill for a lot of simpler learning problems, and takes a lot of time and expertise to learn and also DL algorithms are very slow to train. Additionally, just because you have 50M rows, doesn't mean you need to use the entire dataset to get good results. Depending on the data, you may get good results with a sample of a few 100,000 rows or a few million. I would start simple, with a small sample and a linear classifier, and get more complicated from there if the results are not satisfactory. At least that way you'll get a baseline. We've often found simple linear models to out perform more sophisticated models on most tasks, so you want to always start there.</p>\n",

If this is not a problem then go for it,even the exact answer is relying on the nature of your problem. GBT is a good method especially if you have mixed feature types like categorical, numerical and such. In addition, compared to Neural Networks it has lower number of hyperparameters to be tuned. Therefore, it is faster to have a best setting model. One more thing is the alternative of parallel training. You can train multiple trees at the same time with a good CPU. If you are not satisfied with the results then go for Neural Nets since that means your model should be more extensive and should learn higher order information through your data. That is the due of NNs compared to other learning algorithms. </p>\n",

Considering the case when you have to classify an observation (instance) whih is identical with one observation from the 'learned' data set, than the inverse distance is not defined by a direct formula since you have to divide by zero. But considering the math behind, inverse of the zero distance is positive infinity. Which means that, the weight for the identical point would dominate all other weights of the data instances. Thus the classification for that specific point could be taken as the class of the identical observation from the data set. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand the inverse of the euclidean distance is only one type of distance. You can always apply a kernel function on that to weight non-uniformly the contributions. For example you can choose a normal density with mean equals zero and variance equals 1. Than, your weight would be the value of density function for the euclidean distance. </p>\n",

It has the nice feature that the weight is equal to $1$ when the observation lies exactly at one of your training points and decays to zero as $x\\rightarrow \\infty$.</p>\n\n<p>What you need to decide is the scaling factor, $\\alpha$, which can greatly affect your results, since the decaying exponential is nonlinear. If $\\alpha$ is too small or large, then all $k$ points will be weighted nearly equally (assuming none of the $k$ points have a distance very close to zero). One approach is to pick a global value of $\\alpha$ that is suitable for your data set. Another approach is to compute a new value of $\\alpha$ for each set of $k$ neighbors under consideration, which will guarantee variability in the weights (as long as all $k$ neighbors are not equidistant).</p>\n",

My reasoning would be that, before you move things to a server, you can move a great deal forward by being able to test several different versions in the local environment mentioned above.  Examples of VCS are <a href=\"http://git-scm.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">git</a>, <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">svn</a>, and for the deep nerds, <a href=\"http://darcs.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">darcs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a \"Python server\" where you can deploy your software once it is integrated into a releasable version is something usually called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_site\" rel=\"nofollow\">staging server</a>\".  There is a whole philosophy in software engineering &mdash; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Continuous Integration</a> &mdash; that advocates staging whatever you have in VCS daily or even on each change.  In the end, this means that some automated program, running on the staging server, checks out your code, sees that it compiles, runs all defined tests and maybe outputs a package with a version number.  Examples of such programs are <a href=\"http://jenkins-ci.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jenkins</a>, <a href=\"http://buildbot.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buildbot</a> (this one is Python-specific), and <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/recent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Travis</a> (for cloud-hosted projects).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the hardware requirements for such a box?</strong> None, as far as I can tell.  Whenever it runs out of disk space, you will have to clean up.  Having more CPU speed and memory will make concurrent builds easier, but there is no real minimum.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do I need to be concerned about any specific packages or conflicts between projects?</strong>  Yes, this has been identified as a problem, not only in Python, but in many other systems (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dependency hell</a>).  The established practice is to keep projects isolated from each other as far as their dependencies are concerned.  This means, avoid installing dependencies on the system Python interpreter, even locally; always define a <a href=\"http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">virtual environment</a> and install dependencies there.  Many of the aforementioned CI servers will do that for you anyway.</p>\n",

If you will need to do anything else than statistics with your program (generate a web interface, integrate it with a reporting system, pass it on to other developers for maintenance) you are far better off with Python.</p></li>\n<li><p>the important advantage of R is that it is a specialized language.

If you need to process large quantities of data, or process very fast, or process in parallel, you will run into trouble ... but it is far easier to run into such trouble with R than with Python.  In my experience, you find the limits of R within some weeks, and the way to push them is quite arcane; while you can use Python for years, never really missing the speed that C developers always mention as the Holy Grail, and even when you do, you can use Cython to make up for the difference.  The only real trouble is concurrency, but for statistics, it is hardly ever an issue.</li>\n</ul>\n",

You don't have to go into too much theoretical depth into any of these topics but you should know what these are before you start studying machine learning. Your study in machine learning should include developing an understanding of hypothesis spaces, Bayesian analysis (can you explain the difference between MLE, MAP and optimal Bayes?), Expectation Maximization, logistic regression, clustering (especially k-means), max-margin classifiers (SVMs), overfitting (can you explain what it is in terms of bias and variance?) and feature selection. Linear algebra is helpful but can be done without in many cases.   </p>\n\n<p>As someone who does research in data mining and has worked closely with several companies, I can tell you that if you seriously want to go into machine learning, it is NOT enough to simply know how to code something using Weka or R.

A good grasp of fundamentals is obviously essential, since each company's data has its own quirks (and will typically be too big for you to try 'everything'). Good luck!</p>\n",

                "_Body": "<p>In most of the well established machine learning systems categorical variables are handled naturally. For example in R you would use factors, in weka you would use nominal variables. This is not the care in scikit learn. The decision trees implemented in sklearn uses only numerical features and these features are interpreted always as continuous numeric variables. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, simply replacing the strings with a hash code should be avoided, because being considered as a continuous numerical feature any coding you will use will induce an order which simply does not exists in your data. </p>\n\n<p>One example is to code ['red','green','blue'] with [1,2,3], would produce weird things like 'red' is lower than 'blue', and if you average a 'red' and a 'blue' you will get a 'green'. Another more sublte example maigh happen when you code ['low', 'medium', 'high'] with [1,2,3]. In the latter case it might happen to have an ordering which makes sense, however some sublte inconsistencies might happen when 'medium' in not in the middle of 'low' and 'high'.</p>\n\n<p>Finally the answer to your question lies in coding the categorical feature into multiple binary features. For example you might code ['red','green','blue'] with 3 columns, one for each category, having 1 when the category match and 0 otherwise. This is called one-hot-encoding, binary encoding, one-of-k-encoding or whatever. You can check documentation here for <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">encoding categorical features</a> and <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#dict-feature-extraction\" rel=\"nofollow\">feature extraction - hashing and dicts</a>.

Giving more detail would probably lead to a much better answer; especially as it's a little unusual to approach selection of classification algorithms on the basis of the programming paradigm with which they're associated.

Such tools are targeting mainly <em>advanced users</em> (not <em>data scientists</em>), for example analysts and other subject matter experts, who use <em>graphical user interface (GUI)</em> to <em>analyze</em> and (mostly) <em>visualize</em> data. Having said that, software tools like Tableau might be good enough to perform initial phase of data science <strong>workflow</strong>: <em>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of data science <strong>self-education</strong>, there are several popular online courses (MOOCs) that you can choose from (most come in both free and paid versions). In addition to the one on Udacity that you've mentioned (<a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359</a>), there are two data science courses on Coursera: <em>Introduction to Data Science</em> by University of Washington (<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci</a>) and a set of courses from <em>Data Science specialization</em> by Johns Hopkins University (<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1</a>). Note that you can take specialization's individual courses for free at your convenience. There are several other, albeit less popular, data science MOOCs.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of <strong>data sources</strong>, I'm not sure what do you mean by \"Dummy Data\", but there is a wealth of <em>open data sets</em>, including many in the area of <em>public health</em>. You can review corresponding resources, listed on KDnuggets (<a href=\"http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html</a>) and choose ones that you're interested in. For a country-level analysis, the fastest way to obtain data is finding and visiting corresponding <em>open data</em> government websites. For example, for public health data in US, I would go to <a href=\"http://www.healthdata.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.healthdata.gov</a> and <a href=\"http://www.data.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.data.gov</a> (the latter - for corresponding non-medical data that you might want to include in your analysis).</p>\n\n<p>In regard to <strong>research papers</strong> in the area of public health, I have two comments: 1) most <em>empirical research</em> in that (or any other) area IMHO can be considered a data science study/project; 2) you need to perform a <em>literature review</em> in the area or on the topic of your interest, so you're on your own in that sense.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a note on <strong>software tools</strong>. If you're serious about data science, I would suggest to invest some time in learning either R, or Python (if you don't know them already), as those are two most popular open source tools among data scientists nowadays. Both have a variety of feature-rich <em>development environments</em> as well as large <em>ecosystems</em> of packages/libraries and users/developers all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>You might also find useful some of my other <strong>related answers</strong> here on Data Science StackExchange site.

This is a straightforward classification (supervised learning) problem: the inputs are X, the outputs are the schedules (N->M maps).  Actually, if <em>every</em> N gets scheduled and the only question is which M it gets, the outputs are lists which channel (or none) is scheduled to each block, and there is only a certain possible number of those, so you can model them as discrete outputs (classes) with their own probabilities.  Use whatever you like (AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, RBF SVM, Random Forest...) as a classifier.

The reason why I'm suggesting regression as opposed to 'better' machine learning algorithms is because you said you wanted to learn, and it's important to understand the algorithms (for the long run, and to truly be good at this stuff) that you're using. Regression is the easiest tool in the book that works quite well! Weka is so easy to use that you'll be able to plug and play different machine learning algorithms just for the sake of it. Another pointer that's won me several competitions is to do some feature selection before using regression/machine learning. For example, in your case, it is reasonable to assume that a student who scores high in Physics probably has a better chance of scoring high in Math as opposed to someone who scores high in English (but not necessarily Physics). If you have enough data, the algorithm itself will be able to deduce these positive/negative correlations and train the model accordingly. Sometimes, there isn't enough data, and you have to do some feature selection. Good luck! I'm a regular participant on Kaggle myself, and I think it's great that you're taking the 'hacker' route to learn more.

It measures how much it \"costs\" to optimally reshape one histogram into another, where an elementary transform (using the terminology of edit distance-like distance measures) is moving a unit of mass from a bin to a bin.

If I use RGB, and I do not care much as to how human eye perceives colors, then D21 can be the \\ell_2 norm of the difference [1, 1, 1] - [1, 0.05, 0.7]. (As far as I remember, the paper I mentioned uses LAB instead of RGB.)</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Besides color, you may include spatial information into comparison.

In the system,\nonly 10 matches are given everyday to be predicted. Meaning, if I predict the 10 matches using the second model, I have a chance of predicting 5 \ncorrectly. In this project, I only need to predict 3 matches correctly out of the 10 matches given in a day.

But most of the introductory literature does deal with discrete spaces.</p>\n\n<p>As you might know by now that there are three important components in any Reinforcement Learning problem: Rewards, States and Actions. The first is a scalar quantity and theoretically the latter two can either be discrete or continuous. The convergence proofs and analyses of the various algorithms are easier to understand for the discrete case and also the corresponding algorithms are easier to code. That is one of the reasons, most introductory material focuses on them.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, it should be interesting to note that the early research on Reinforcement Learning actually focussed on continuous state representations. It was only in the the 90s since the literature started representing all the standard algorithms for discrete spaces as we had a lot of proofs for them.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you noticed carefully, I said continuous states only. Mapping continuous states and continuous actions is hard. Nevertheless, we do have some solutions for now.

                "_Body": "<p>Most common types of decision trees you encounter are not affected by any monotonic transformation. So, as long as you preserve orde, the decision trees are the same (obviously by the same tree here I understand the same decision structure, not the same values for each test in each node of the tree). </p>\n\n<p>The reason why it happens is because how usual impurity functions works. In order to find the best split it searches on each dimension (attribute) a split point which is basically an if clause which groups target values corresponding to instances which has test value less than split value, and on the right the values greater than equal. This happens for numerical attributes (which I think is your case because I do not know how to normalize a nominal attribute). Now you might note that the criteria is less than or greater than. Which means that the real information from the attributes in order to find the split (and the whole tree) is only the order of the values. Which means that as long as you transform your attributes in such a way that the original ordering is reserved, you will get the same tree. </p>\n\n<p>Not all models are insensitive to such kind of transformation. For example linear regression models give the same results if you multiply an attribute with something different than zero. You will get different regression coefficients, but the predicted value will be the same. This is not the case when you take a log of that transformation. So for linear regression, for example, normalizing is useless since it will provide the same result. </p>\n\n<p>However this is not the case with a penalized linear regression, like ridge regression. In penalized linear regressions a constraint is applied to coefficients. The idea is that the constraint is applied to the sum  of a function of coefficients. Now if you inflate an attribute, the coefficient will be deflated, which means that in the end the penalization for that coefficient it will be artificially modified. In such kind of situation, you normalize attributes in order that each coefficient to be constraint 'fairly'.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps</p>\n",

Each column of your matrix corresponds to a \"source node\" in the left part of the bipartite graph $BP(L, R)$; each row of the matrix corresponds to a \"destination node\" in the right part $R$. Capacity of each source node is the corresponding column's sum; similarly, capacities are defined for the destinations via row sums. Value $a_{ij}$ in the matrix describes flow of mass from $j$'th source to $i$'th destination along an existing edge $(j \\to i)$ of $BP$. Your initially given 0-1 matrix describes which edges are present (e.g., the matrix in your example prescribes the edge $(3, 2)$ to be absent from the network, along with all self-loops). If you denote $F$ to be the sum of all column sums (or, alternatively, the total capacity of all sources), then your problem narrows down to finding a max-flow from $L$ to $R$ in $BP$ and checking whether the volume of the discovered flow equals $F$.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note 1 (Feasibility):</em> Before plunging into finding best flows, you may want to check your row sums: a necessary condition for your problem to have a solution is that the sum of all column sums (which is $N$ in your particular case of a column-stochastic matrix) should be equal the sum of row sums, as both numbers describe the same -- the sum of all elements of the target matrix. (For example, for $N = 3$ and the vector of row sums from your example, the problem is unfeasible.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Note 2 (Upper bound):</em> Since $a_{ij}$ describes the flow from $j$'th source, and the capacities of all sources are 1 in your setting, then each source cannot send more than 1 unit of mass to a single destination. Thus, each $a_{ij}$ will not exceed 1.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note 3 (Lower bound):</em> To make $a_{ij}$ for each existing edge $(j \\to i)$ strictly positive, you can augment the max-flow problem with lower bounds on edge capacities. In a general setting, edge capacity bounds are $0$ and $+\\infty$. You may want to replace the lower bound with some positive number, small enough not to interfere with the discovery of the best flow and large enough to satisfy your edge saturation needs.</p>\n",

If $M\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}$) is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">diagonizable matrix</a>, it has an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">eigendecomposition</a>\n\\begin{equation}\nM = V\\Delta V^{-1}\n\\textrm{,}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $V:=\\begin{bmatrix}v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{n}\\end{bmatrix}$ the matrix with its $n$ eigenvectors $v_{i}$ as columns and $\\Delta:=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{n}\\right)$ the diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues on its main diagonal.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see from this equation if you want to get matrices with the same eigenvectors, i.e. $V$ fixed, you can only change the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{i}$. In general the relationship between the eigenvalues and the entries of the original matrix $M$ is non-trivial. </p>\n\n<p>The easiest situation arises if the eigenvectors $v_{i}$ form the standard basis, i.e. only $1$ at the $i$th position, $0$ otherwise. Then $M=I\\Delta I^{-1}=\\Delta$ ($I$ the identity matrix) and you can change every entry on the main diagonal without changing any eigenvector. </p>\n",
